[{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music", "content": "\n\nHeavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and United States.[2] With roots in blues rock, psychedelic rock and acid rock, heavy metal bands developed a thick, monumental sound characterized by distorted guitars, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats and loudness.\n\nIn 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers \u2013 British bands Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple \u2013 were founded.[3] Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen.[4] During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence,[5][6] while Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\". The lyrics of some metal genres became associated with aggression and machismo,[7] an issue that has at times led to accusations of misogyny.\n\nDuring the 1980s, glam metal became popular with groups such as Bon Jovi, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison. Meanwhile, however, underground scenes produced an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres such as death metal and black metal became \u2013 and remain \u2013 subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s, popular styles have expanded the definition of the genre. These include groove metal and nu metal, the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip-hop.\n\nHeavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound and vigorous vocals. Heavy metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter or omit one or more of these attributes. In a 1988 article, The New York Times critic Jon Pareles wrote, \"In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock\u2014the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force.\"[8] The typical band lineup includes a drummer, a bassist, a rhythm guitarist, a lead guitarist and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. Keyboard instruments are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound.[9] Deep Purple's Jon Lord played an overdriven Hammond organ. In 1970, John Paul Jones used a Moog synthesizer on Led Zeppelin III; by the 1990s, synthesizers were used in \"almost every subgenre of heavy metal\".[10]\n\nThe electric guitar and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.[11] The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy fuzz.[12] For classic heavy metal guitar tone, guitarists maintain gain at moderate levels, without excessive preamp or pedal distortion, to retain open spaces and air in the music; the guitar amplifier is turned up loud to produce the \"punch and grind\" characteristic.[13] Thrash metal guitar tone has scooped mid-frequencies and tightly compressed sound with multiple bass frequencies.[13] Guitar solos are \"an essential element of the heavy metal code\u00a0... that underscores the significance of the guitar\" to the genre.[14] Most heavy metal songs \"feature at least one guitar solo\",[15] which is \"a primary means through which the heavy metal performer expresses virtuosity\".[16] Some exceptions are nu metal and grindcore bands, which tend to omit guitar solos.[17] With rhythm guitar parts, the \"heavy crunch sound in heavy metal\u00a0... [is created by] palm muting\" the strings with the picking hand and using distortion.[18] Palm muting creates a tighter, more precise sound and it emphasizes the low end.[19]\n\nThe lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional \"frontman\" or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two \"contend for dominance\" in a spirit of \"affectionate rivalry\".[9] Heavy metal \"demands the subordination of the voice\" to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an \"explicit display of emotion\" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.[20] Critic Simon Frith claims that the metal singer's \"tone of voice\" is more important than the lyrics.[21]\n\nThe prominent role of the bass \u200dis also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music \"heavy\".[22] The bass plays a \"more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock\".[23] Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low pedal point as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and licks along with the lead or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's Cliff Burton with his heavy emphasis on bass \u200dsolos and use of chords while playing the \u200dbass in the early 1980s.[24] Lemmy of Mot\u00f6rhead often played overdriven power chords in his bass lines.[25]\n\nThe essence of heavy metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the \"trifecta of speed, power, and precision\".[26] Heavy metal drumming \"requires an exceptional amount of endurance\", and drummers have to develop \"considerable speed, coordination, and dexterity\u00a0... to play the intricate patterns\" used in heavy metal.[27] A characteristic metal drumming technique is the cymbal choke, which consists of striking a cymbal and then immediately silencing it by grabbing it with the other hand (or, in some cases, the same striking hand), producing a burst of sound. The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.[22] Black metal, death metal and some \"mainstream metal\" bands \"all depend upon double-kicks and blast beats\".[28]\n\nIn live performance, loudness \u2013 an \"onslaught of sound\", in sociologist Deena Weinstein's description \u2013 is considered vital.[11] In his book, Metalheads, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as \"the sensory equivalent of war\".[29] Following the lead set by Jimi Hendrix, Cream and the Who, early heavy metal acts such as Blue Cheer set new benchmarks for volume. As Blue Cheer's Dick Peterson put it, \"All we knew was we wanted more power.\"[30] A 1977 review of a Mot\u00f6rhead concert noted how \"excessive volume in particular figured into the band's impact\".[31] Weinstein makes the case that in the same way that melody is the main element of pop and rhythm is the main focus of house music, powerful sound, timbre and volume are the key elements of metal. She argues that the loudness is designed to \"sweep the listener into the sound\" and to provide a \"shot of youthful vitality\".[11]\n\nHeavy metal performers tended to be almost exclusively male[32] until at least the mid-1980s,[33] with some exceptions such as Girlschool.[32] However, by the 2010s, women were making more of an impact,[34][35] and PopMatters' Craig Hayes argues that metal \"clearly empowers women\".[36] In the power metal and symphonic metal subgenres, there has been a sizable number of bands that have had women as the lead singers, such as Nightwish, Delain and Within Temptation.\n\nThe rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the \"rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency\".[22] In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two- or three-note rhythmic figures \u2013 generally made up of eighth or 16th notes. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a staccato attack created by using a palm-muted technique on the rhythm guitar.[37]\n\nBrief, abrupt and detached rhythmic cells are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called riffs, which help to establish thematic hooks. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as whole note- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo power ballads. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be \"slow, even ponderous\".[22] By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos, and as recently as the 2000s, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 beats per minute) to extremely fast blast beat tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).[27]\n\nOne of the signatures of the genre is the guitar power chord.[38] In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main interval, generally the perfect fifth, though an octave may be added as a doubling of the root. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, additional low-frequency sounds are created, which add to the \"weight of the sound\" and create an effect of \"overwhelming power\".[39] Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord,[40] power chords are also based on different intervals such as the minor third, major third, perfect fourth, diminished fifth or minor sixth.[41] Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the fretboard.[42]\n\nHeavy metal is usually based on riffs created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of pedal points. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the Aeolian and Phrygian modes.[43] Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-\u266dVI-\u266dVII, I-\u266dVII-(\u266dVI), or I-\u266dVI-IV-\u266dVII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and \u266dII (I-\u266dII-I, I-\u266dII-III, or I-\u266dII-VII for example). Tense-sounding chromatic or tritone relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.[44][45] In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses \"pentatonic and blues-derived features\".[46]\n\nThe tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones \u2013 such as C to F# \u2013 was considered extremely dissonant and unstable by medieval and Renaissance music theorists. It was nicknamed the diabolus in musica \u2013 \"the devil in music\".[47]\n\nHeavy metal songs often make extensive use of pedal point as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.[48] According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are \"often quite complex\" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is \"often very sophisticated\".[49] In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that \"heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated\" than other music researchers had realized.[46]\n\nRobert Walser stated that, alongside blues and R&B, the \"assemblage of disparate musical styles known\u00a0... as 'classical music'\" has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days, and that metal's \"most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal.\"[50]\n\nIn an article written for Grove Music Online, Walser stated that the \"1980s brought on\u00a0... the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially Bach and Antonio Vivaldi, by influential guitarists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Marty Friedman, Jason Becker, Uli Jon Roth, Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen.\"[51] Kurt Bachmann of Believer has stated that \"if done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together. Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity.\"[52]\n\nAlthough a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices \u2013 classical in the art music tradition, metal in the popular music tradition. As musicologists Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note: \"Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions.' An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century Romanticism. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from \"art music.'\"[53]\n\nAccording to David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath and the numerous heavy metal bands that they inspired have concentrated lyrically \"on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music.\" They take as an example Black Sabbath's second album, Paranoid (1970), which \"included songs dealing with personal trauma\u2014'Paranoid' and 'Fairies Wear Boots' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)\u2014as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory 'War Pigs' and 'Hand of Doom.'\"[54] Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic \u2013 a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam metal and nu metal bands.[55]\n\nThe thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, \"Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates\u00a0... a party without limits\u00a0... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.\"[8] Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others[56] have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs.[57] Andrew Cope stated that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are \"clearly misguided\" as these critics have \"overlook[ed] the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise\".[58] Music critic Robert Christgau called metal \"an expressive mode [that] it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat\".[59]\n\nHeavy metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court. In 1985, Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider was asked to defend his song \"Under the Blade\" at a U.S. Senate hearing. At the hearing, the PMRC alleged that the song was about sadomasochism and rape; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate's throat surgery.[60] In 1986, Ozzy Osbourne was sued over the lyrics of his song \"Suicide Solution\".[61] A lawsuit against Osbourne was filed by the parents of John McCollum, a depressed teenager who committed suicide allegedly after listening to Osbourne's song. Osbourne was not found to be responsible for the teen's death.[62] In 1990, Judas Priest was sued in American court by the parents of two young men who had shot themselves five years earlier, allegedly after hearing the subliminal statement \"do it\" in the band's cover of the song \"Better by You, Better than Me\".[63] While the case attracted a great deal of media attention, it was ultimately dismissed.[57] In 1991, U.K. police seized death metal records from the British record label Earache Records, in an \"unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the label for obscenity\".[64]\n\nIn some predominantly Muslim countries, heavy metal has been officially denounced as a threat to traditional values, and in countries such as Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon and Malaysia, there have been incidents of heavy metal musicians and fans being arrested and incarcerated.[65] In 1997, the Egyptian police jailed many young metal fans, and they were accused of \"devil worship\" and blasphemy after police found metal recordings during searches of their homes.[64] In 2013, Malaysia banned Lamb of God from performing in their country, on the grounds that the \"band's lyrics could be interpreted as being religiously insensitive\" and blasphemous.[66] Some people consider heavy metal music to be a leading factor for mental health disorders, and that heavy metal fans are more likely to suffer poor mental health, but a study from 2009 suggests that this is not true and that fans of heavy metal music suffer from poor mental health at a similar or lower rate compared to the general population.[67]\n\nFor many artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's image is expressed in album cover art, logos, stage sets, clothing, design of instruments and music videos.[68]\n\nDown-the-back long hair is the \"most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion\".[69] Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s, heavy metal hair \"symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home\", according to journalist Nader Rahman. Long hair gave members of the metal community \"the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general\".[70]\n\nThe classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of light-colored, ripped, frayed or torn blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots, and black leather or denim jackets. Deena Weinstein wrote, \"T-shirts are generally emblazoned with the logos or other visual representations of favorite metal bands.\"[71] In the 1980s, a range of sources \u2013 from punk rock and goth music to horror films \u2013 influenced metal fashion.[72] Many metal performers of the 1970s and 1980s used radically shaped and brightly colored instruments to enhance their stage appearance.[73][74]\n\nFashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname \"hair metal\"); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry.[73] Pioneered by the heavy metal act X Japan in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as visual kei, which includes many non-metal groups, emphasize elaborate costumes, hair and makeup.[75]\n\nWhen performing live, many metal musicians \u2013 as well as the audience for whom they're playing \u2013 engage in headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating time with the head, often emphasized by long hair. The il cornuto, or \"devil horns\", hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio during his time with the bands Black Sabbath and Dio.[45] Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims to have been the first to make the gesture on the 1977 Love Gun album cover, there is speculation as to who started the phenomenon.[76]\n\nAttendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense. It has been argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and \"extreme heterosexualist ideology\". Two primary body movements used are headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture.[77] The performance of air guitar is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home.[78] According to Deena Weinstein, thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: moshing and stage diving, which \"were imported from the punk/hardcore subculture\".[79] Weinstein states that moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the \"pit\" near the stage. Stage divers climb onto the stage with the band and then jump \"back into the audience\".[79]\n\nIt has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary and strongly masculine subculture.[80] While the metal fan base is largely young, white, male and blue-collar, the group is \"tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior\".[81] Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the group experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites.[82] Attending live concerts in particular has been called the \"holiest of heavy metal communions\".[83]\n\nThe metal scene has been characterized as a \"subculture of alienation\" with its own code of authenticity.[84] This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear uninterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never \"sell out\".[85] Deena Weinstein stated that for the fans themselves, the code promotes \"opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society\".[86]\n\nMusician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observed, \"Most of the kids who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of creative energy they don't know what to do with\" and that metal is \"outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place.\"[87] Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as \"poseurs\" \"who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity\".[84][88]\n\nThe origin of the term \"heavy metal\" in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both light and heavy metals (e.g., uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by countercultural writer William S. Burroughs. His 1961 novel The Soft Machine includes a character known as \"Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid\". Burroughs' next novel, Nova Express (1964), develops the theme, using \"heavy metal\" as a metaphor for addictive drugs: \"With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms\u2014Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes\u2014And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music.\"[89] Inspired by Burroughs' novels,[90] the term was used in the title of the 1967 album Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids by Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music.[91] The phrase was later lifted by Sandy Pearlman, who used the term to describe the Byrds for their supposed \"aluminium style of context and effect\", particularly on their album The Notorious Byrd Brothers (1968).[92]\n\nMetal historian Ian Christe describes what the components of the term mean in \"hippiespeak\": \"heavy\" is roughly synonymous with \"potent\" or \"profound\", and \"metal\" designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal.[93] The word \"heavy\" in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural hippie slang, and references to \"heavy music\" \u2013 typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare \u2013 were already common by the mid-1960s, such as in reference to Vanilla Fudge. Iron Butterfly's debut album, which was released in early 1968, was titled Heavy. The first use of \"heavy metal\" in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song \"Born to Be Wild\", also released that year:[94] \"I like smoke and lightning / Heavy metal thunder / Racin' with the wind / And the feelin' that I'm under\".\n\nAn early documented use of the phrase in rock criticism appears in Sandy Pearlman's February 1967 Crawdaddy review of the Rolling Stones' Got Live If You Want It (1966), albeit as a description of the sound rather than as a genre: \"On this album the Stones go metal. Technology is in the saddle\u2014as an ideal and as a method.\"[95][nb 1] Another appears in the 11 May 1968 issue of Rolling Stone, in which Barry Gifford wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: \"Nobody who's been listening to Mike Bloomfield\u2014either talking or playing\u2014in the last few years could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock.\"[97] In the 7 September 1968 edition of the Seattle Daily Times, reviewer Susan Schwartz wrote that the Jimi Hendrix Experience \"has a heavy-metals blues sound\".[98] In January 1970, Lucian K. Truscott IV, reviewing Led Zeppelin II for the Village Voice, described the sound as \"heavy\" and made comparisons with Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.[99]\n\nOther early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic Metal Mike Saunders. In the 12 November 1970 issue of Rolling Stone, he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band Humble Pie: \"Safe as Yesterday Is, their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There were a couple of nice songs\u00a0... and one monumental pile of refuse.\" He described the band's latest, self-titled release as \"more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap\".[100]\n\nIn a review of Sir Lord Baltimore's Kingdom Come in the May 1971 edition of Creem, Saunders wrote, \"Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book.\"[101] Creem critic Lester Bangs is credited with popularizing the term via his early 1970s essays on bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.[102] Through the decade, \"heavy metal\" was used by certain critics as a virtually automatic putdown. In 1979, lead New York Times popular music critic John Rockwell described what he called \"heavy-metal rock\" as \"brutally aggressive music played mostly for minds clouded by drugs\"[103] and, in a different article, as \"a crude exaggeration of rock basics that appeals to white teenagers\".[104]\n\nCoined by Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, \"downer rock\" was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to acts such as Sabbath and Bloodrock. Classic Rock magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of Quaaludes and the drinking of wine.[105] The term would later be replaced by \"heavy metal\".[106]\n\nEarlier on, as \"heavy metal\" emerged partially from heavy psychedelic rock, also known as acid rock, \"acid rock\" was often used interchangeably with \"heavy metal\" and \"hard rock\". \"Acid rock\" generally describes heavy, hard or raw psychedelic rock. Musicologist Steve Waksman stated that \"the distinction between acid rock, hard rock, and heavy metal can at some point never be more than tenuous\",[107] while percussionist John Beck defined \"acid rock\" as synonymous with hard rock and heavy metal.[108]\n\nApart from \"acid rock\", the terms \"heavy metal\" and \"hard rock\" have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous.[109] For example, the 1983 edition of the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll includes the following passage: \"Known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, Aerosmith was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies\".[110]\n\n\"The term 'heavy metal' is self-defeating,\" remarked Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. \"When I think of heavy metal, I've always thought of elves and evil dwarves and evil princes and princesses. A lot of the Maiden and Priest records were real metal records. I sure as hell don't think Metallica's metal, or Guns N' Roses is metal, or Kiss is metal. It just doesn't deal with the ground opening up and little dwarves coming out riding dragons! You know, like bad Dio records.\"[111]\n\nHeavy metal's quintessential guitar style, which is built around distortion-heavy riffs and power chords, traces its roots to early 1950s Memphis blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson and particularly Pat Hare,[112][113] who captured a \"grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound\" on records such as James Cotton's \"Cotton Crop Blues\" (1954).[113] Other early influences include the late 1950s instrumentals of Link Wray, particularly \"Rumble\" (1958);[114] the early 1960s surf rock of Dick Dale, including \"Let's Go Trippin'\" (1961) and \"Misirlou\" (1962); and The Kingsmen's version of \"Louie Louie\" (1963), which became a garage rock standard.[115]\n\nHowever, the genre's direct lineage begins in the mid-1960s. American blues music was a major influence on the early British rockers of the era. Bands like The Rolling Stones and The Yardbirds developed blues rock by recording covers of classic blues songs, often speeding up the tempos. As they experimented with the music, the U.K. blues-based bands \u2013 and in turn the U.S. acts they influenced \u2013 developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal (in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound).[30] The Kinks played a major role in popularising this sound with their 1964 hit \"You Really Got Me\".[116]\n\nIn addition to The Kinks' Dave Davies, other guitarists such as The Who's Pete Townshend and The Yardbirds' Jeff Beck were experimenting with feedback.[117][118] Where the blues rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar.[119] Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic. In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, The Who's \"bigger-louder-wall-of-Marshalls\" approach was seminal to the development of the later heavy metal sound.[120]\n\nThe combination of this loud and heavy blues rock with psychedelic rock and acid rock formed much of the original basis for heavy metal.[121] The variant or subgenre of psychedelic rock often known as \"acid rock\" was particularly influential on heavy metal and its development; acid rock is often defined as a heavier, louder, or harder variant of psychedelic rock,[122] or the more extreme side of the psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and heavily distorted, guitar-centered sound. Acid rock has been described as psychedelic rock at its \"rawest and most intense\", emphasizing the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience rather than only the idyllic side of psychedelia.[123] In  contrast to more idyllic or whimsical pop psychedelic rock, American acid rock garage bands such as the 13th Floor Elevators epitomized the frenetic, heavier, darker, and more psychotic psychedelic rock sound known as acid rock, a sound characterized by droning guitar riffs, amplified feedback, and guitar distortion, while the 13th Floor Elevators' sound in particular featured yelping vocals and \"occasionally demented\" lyrics.[124] Frank Hoffman noted that \"[Psychedelic rock] was sometimes referred to as 'acid rock'. The latter label was applied to a pounding, hard rock variant that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage-punk movement.\u00a0... When rock began turning back to softer, roots-oriented sounds in late 1968, acid-rock bands mutated into heavy metal acts.\"[125]\n\nOne of the most influential bands in forging the merger of psychedelic rock and acid rock with the blues rock genre was the British power trio Cream, who derived a massive, heavy sound from unison riffing between guitarist Eric Clapton and bassist Jack Bruce, as well as Ginger Baker's double bass drumming.[126] Their first two LPs \u2013 Fresh Cream (1966) and Disraeli Gears (1967) \u2013 are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style of heavy metal. The Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut album, Are You Experienced (1967), was also highly influential. Hendrix's virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists, and the album's most successful single, \"Purple Haze\", is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit.[30] Vanilla Fudge, whose first album also came out in 1967, has been called \"one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal,\"[127] and the band has been cited as an early American heavy metal group.[128] On their self-titled debut album, Vanilla Fudge created \"loud, heavy, slowed-down arrangements\" of contemporary hit songs, blowing these songs up to \"epic proportions\" and \"bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze\".[127]\n\nDuring the late 1960s, many psychedelic singers, such as Arthur Brown, began to create outlandish, theatrical, and often macabre performances that influenced many metal acts.[129][130][131] The American psychedelic rock band Coven, who opened for early heavy metal influencers such as Vanilla Fudge and the Yardbirds, portrayed themselves as practitioners of witchcraft or black magic, using dark \u2013 Satanic or occult \u2013 imagery in their lyrics, album art and live performances, which consisted of elaborate, theatrical \"Satanic rites\". Coven's 1969 debut album, Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls, featured imagery of skulls, black masses, inverted crosses, and Satan worship, and both the album artwork and the band's live performances marked the first appearances in rock music of the sign of the horns, which would later become an important gesture in heavy metal culture.[132][133] Coven's lyrical and thematic influences on heavy metal were quickly overshadowed by the darker and heavier sounds of Black Sabbath.[132][133]\n\nCritics disagree over who can be thought of as the first heavy metal band. Most credit the British bands Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, with American commentators tending to favour Led Zeppelin and British commentators tending to favour Black Sabbath, though many give equal credit to both. Deep Purple, the third band in what is sometimes considered the \"unholy trinity\" of heavy metal along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, fluctuated between many rock styles until late 1969 when they took a heavy metal direction.[134] A few commentators \u2013 mainly American \u2013 argue for other groups, including Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf, Blue Cheer, or Vanilla Fudge, as the first to play heavy metal.[135]\n\nIn 1968, the sound that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce. That January, San Francisco band Blue Cheer released a cover of Eddie Cochran's classic \"Summertime Blues\" as a part of their debut album, Vincebus Eruptum, and many consider it to be the first true heavy metal recording.[136][137] The same month, Steppenwolf released their self-titled debut album, on which the track \"Born to Be Wild\" refers to \"heavy metal thunder\" in describing a motorcycle. In July, the Jeff Beck Group, whose leader had preceded Page as The Yardbirds' guitarist, released its debut record, Truth, which featured some of the \"most molten, barbed, downright funny noises of all time\", breaking ground for generations of metal ax-slingers.[138] In September, Page's new band, Led Zeppelin, made its live debut in Denmark (but were billed as The New Yardbirds).[139] The Beatles' self-titled double album, released in November, included \"Helter Skelter\", then one of the heaviest-sounding songs ever released by a major band.[140] The Pretty Things' rock opera S.F. Sorrow, released in December, featured \"proto heavy metal\" songs such as \"Old Man Going\" and \"I See You\".[141][142] Iron Butterfly's 1968 song \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" is sometimes described as an example of the transition between acid rock and heavy metal[143] or the turning point in which acid rock became \"heavy metal\",[144] and both Iron Butterfly's 1968 album In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and Blue Cheer's 1968 album Vincebus Eruptum have been described as laying the foundation of heavy metal and greatly influential in the transformation of acid rock into heavy metal.[145]\n\nIn this counterculture period, MC5, who began as part of the Detroit garage rock scene, developed a raw, distorted style that has been seen as a major influence on the future sound of both heavy metal and later punk music.[146][147] The Stooges also began to establish and influence a heavy metal and later punk sound, with songs such as \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\", featuring pounding and distorted heavy guitar power chord riffs.[148] Pink Floyd released two of their heaviest and loudest songs to date, \"Ibiza Bar\" and \"The Nile Song\", the latter of which being regarded as \"one of the heaviest songs the band recorded.\"[149][150] King Crimson's debut album started with \"21st Century Schizoid Man\", which was considered heavy metal by several critics.[151][152]\n\nIn January 1969, Led Zeppelin's self-titled debut album was released and reached No. 10 on the Billboard album chart. In July, Led Zeppelin and a power trio with a Cream-inspired, but cruder sound, called Grand Funk Railroad played the Atlanta Pop Festival. That same month, another Cream-rooted trio led by Leslie West released Mountain, an album filled with heavy blues rock guitar and roaring vocals. In August, the group \u2013 now itself dubbed Mountain \u2013 played an hour-long set at the Woodstock Festival, exposing the crowd of 300,000 people to the emerging sound of heavy metal.[153][154] Mountain's proto-metal or early heavy metal hit song \"Mississippi Queen\" from the album Climbing! is especially credited with paving the way for heavy metal and was one of the first heavy guitar songs to receive regular play on radio.[153][155][156] In September 1969, the Beatles released the album Abbey Road containing the track \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\", which has been credited as an early example of or influence on heavy metal or doom metal.[157][158] In October 1969, British band High Tide debuted with the heavy, proto-metal album Sea Shanties.[159][144]\n\nLed Zeppelin defined central aspects of the emerging genre, with Page's highly distorted guitar style and singer Robert Plant's dramatic, wailing vocals.[160] Other bands, with a more consistently heavy, \"purely\" metal sound, would prove equally important in codifying the genre. The 1970 releases by Black Sabbath (Black Sabbath, which is generally accepted as the first heavy metal album,[161] and Paranoid) and Deep Purple (Deep Purple in Rock) were crucial in this regard.[119]\n\nBirmingham's Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to a work accident in which guitarist Tony Iommi lost the ends of two fingers.[162] Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering.[163] The bleak, industrial, working-class environment of Birmingham, a manufacturing city full of noisy factories and metalworking, has itself been credited with influencing Black Sabbath's heavy, chugging, metallic sound \u2013 and the sound of heavy metal in general.[164][165][166][167]\n\nDeep Purple had fluctuated between styles in its early years, but by 1969, vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led the band toward the developing heavy metal style.[134] In 1970, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple scored major U.K. chart hits with \"Paranoid\" and \"Black Night\", respectively.[168][169] That same year, two other British bands released debut albums in a heavy metal mode: Uriah Heep with ...\u00a0Very 'Eavy\u00a0... Very 'Umble and UFO with UFO 1. Bloodrock released their self-titled debut album, a collection of heavy guitar riffs, gruff style vocals and sadistic and macabre lyrics.[170] The influential Budgie brought the new metal sound into a power trio context, creating some of the heaviest music of the time.[171] The occult lyrics and imagery employed by Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep would prove particularly influential; Led Zeppelin also began foregrounding such elements with its fourth album, released in 1971.[172] In 1973, Deep Purple released the song \"Smoke on the Water\", whose iconic riff is usually considered as the most recognizable one in \"heavy rock\" history, as a single of the classic live album Made in Japan.[173][174]\n\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, the trendsetting group was Grand Funk Railroad, who was described as \"the most commercially successful American heavy-metal band from 1970 until they disbanded in 1976, [they] established the Seventies success formula: continuous touring.\"[175] Other influential bands identified with metal emerged in the U.S. such as Sir Lord Baltimore (Kingdom Come, 1970), Blue \u00d6yster Cult (Blue \u00d6yster Cult, 1972), Aerosmith (Aerosmith, 1973) and Kiss (Kiss, 1974). Sir Lord Baltimore's 1970 debut album and both Humble Pie's debut and self-titled third album were among the first albums to be described in print as \"heavy metal\", with As Safe As Yesterday Is referred to by the term \"heavy metal\" in a 1970 review in Rolling Stone magazine.[176][177][101][100] Various smaller bands from the U.S., U.K. and Continental Europe \u2013 including Bang, Josefus, Leaf Hound, Primeval, Hard Stuff, Truth and Janey, Dust, JPT Scare Band, Frijid Pink, Cactus, Irish Coffee, May Blitz, Captain Beyond, Toad, Granicus, Iron Claw, and Yesterday's Children \u2013 though lesser known outside of their respective scenes, proved to be greatly influential on the emerging metal movement. In Germany, Scorpions debuted with Lonesome Crow in 1972. Blackmore, who had emerged as a virtuoso soloist with Deep Purple's highly influential album Machine Head (1972), left the band in 1975 to form Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio, singer and bassist for blues rock band Elf and future vocalist for Black Sabbath and heavy metal band Dio. Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio would expand on the mystical and fantasy-based lyrics and themes sometimes found in heavy metal, pioneering both power metal and neoclassical metal.[178] These bands also built audiences via constant touring and increasingly elaborate stage shows.[119]\n\nThere are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as \"heavy metal\" or simply as \"hard rock\". Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. AC/DC, which debuted with High Voltage in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 Rolling Stone encyclopedia entry begins, \"Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC ...\"[179] Rock historian Clinton Walker wrote, \"Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today.\u00a0... [They] were a rock 'n' roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal.\"[180] The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification; Ian Christe describes how the band \"became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition\".[181]\n\nIn certain cases, there is little debate. After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's Judas Priest, which debuted with Rocka Rolla in 1974. In Christe's description,\n\nBlack Sabbath's audience was\u00a0... left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of Thin Lizzy, in the stagecraft of Alice Cooper, in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of Queen, and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow.\u00a0... Judas Priest arrived to unify and amplify these diverse highlights from hard rock's sonic palette. For the first time, heavy metal became a true genre unto itself.[182]\nThough Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the United States until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a non-bluesy, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts.[5] While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not enamored of the music. Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice,[183] but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, Robert Christgau described it as \"dull and decadent\u00a0... dim-witted, amoral exploitation.\"[184]\n\nPunk rock emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal. Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, disco and more mainstream rock.[183] With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and \"lo-fi\", do it yourself ethos. Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.[185]\n\nMot\u00f6rhead, founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide. With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed. British music magazines such as the NME and Sounds took notice, with Sounds writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\".[186] NWOBHM bands including Iron Maiden, Saxon and Def Leppard re-energized the heavy metal genre. Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Mot\u00f6rhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements and emphasized increasingly fast tempos.[187]\n\n\"This seemed to be the resurgence of heavy metal,\" noted Ronnie James Dio, who joined Black Sabbath in 1979. \"I've never thought there was a desurgence of heavy metal \u2013 if that's a word! \u2013 but it was important to me that, yet again [after Rainbow], I could be involved in something that was paving the way for those who are going to come after me.\"[188]\n\nBy 1980, the NWOBHM had broken into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Mot\u00f6rhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, NWOBHM bands such as Venom and Diamond Head would have a significant influence on metal's development.[189] In 1981, Mot\u00f6rhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the U.K. charts with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith.[190]\n\nThe first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight. Deep Purple broke up soon after Blackmore's departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin split following drummer John Bonham's death in 1980. Black Sabbath were plagued with infighting and substance abuse, while facing fierce competition from their opening band, Van Halen.[191][192] Eddie Van Halen established himself as one of the leading metal guitarists of the era. His solo on \"Eruption\", from the band's self-titled 1978 album, is considered a milestone.[193] Eddie Van Halen's sound even crossed over into pop music when his guitar solo was featured on the track \"Beat It\" by Michael Jackson, which reached No. 1 in the U.S. in February 1983.[194]\n\nInspired by Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California during the late 1970s. Based on the clubs of L.A.'s Sunset Strip, bands such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Quiet Riot, Ratt and W.A.S.P. were influenced by traditional heavy metal of the 1970s.[195] These acts incorporated the theatrics (and sometimes makeup) of glam metal or \"hair metal\" bands such as Alice Cooper and Kiss.[196] Glam metal bands were often visually distinguished by long, overworked hairstyles accompanied by wardrobes which were sometimes considered cross-gender. The lyrics of these glam metal bands characteristically emphasized hedonism and wild behavior, including lyrics that involved sexual expletives and the use of narcotics.[197]\nIn the wake of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and Judas Priest's breakthrough with British Steel (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on MTV, which began airing in 1981; sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel.[198] Def Leppard's videos for Pyromania (1983) made them superstars in America, and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the Billboard chart with Metal Health (1983). One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 US Festival in California, where the \"heavy metal day\" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Judas Priest and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.[199]\n\nBetween 1983 and 1984, heavy metal's share of all recordings sold in the U.S. increased from 8% to 20%.[200] Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including Kerrang! in 1981 and Metal Hammer in 1984, as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, Billboard declared: \"Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers. The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female.\"[201]\n\nBy the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, music television and the arena concert circuit. New bands such as L.A.'s Warrant and acts from the East Coast like Poison and Cinderella became major draws, while M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Ratt remained very popular. Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, New Jersey's Bon Jovi became enormously successful with its third album, Slippery When Wet (1986). The similarly styled Swedish band Europe became international stars with The Final Countdown (1986), whose title track hit No. 1 in 25 countries.[202] In 1987, MTV launched Headbangers Ball, a show devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos. However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as \"light metal\" or \"hair metal\".[203]\n\nOne band that reached diverse audiences was Guns N' Roses. In contrast to their glam metal contemporaries in L.A., they were seen as much more raw and dangerous.[citation needed] With the release of their chart-topping album Appetite for Destruction in 1987, they \"recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years\".[204] The following year, Jane's Addiction emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with their major-label debut, Nothing's Shocking. Reviewing the album, Steve Pond of Rolling Stone declared, \"As much as any band in existence, Jane's Addiction is the true heir to Led Zeppelin.\"[205] The group was one of the first to be identified with the \"alternative metal\" trend that would come to the fore in the next decade. Meanwhile, new bands like New York City's Winger and New Jersey's Skid Row sustained the popularity of the glam metal style.[206]\n\nMany subgenres of heavy metal developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s,[207] such as crossover thrash. Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of AllMusic, as well as critic Garry Sharpe-Young. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: thrash metal, death metal, black metal, power metal and the related subgenres of doom and gothic metal.[208]\n\nIn 1990, a review in Rolling Stone suggested retiring the term \"heavy metal\" as the genre was \"ridiculously vague\".[209] The article stated that the term only fueled \"misperceptions of rock & roll bigots who still assume that five bands as different as Ratt, Extreme, Anthrax, Danzig and Mother Love Bone\" sound the same.[209]\n\nThrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of hardcore punk and the New Wave of British Heavy Metal,[210] particularly songs in the revved-up style known as speed metal. The movement began in the United States, with Bay Area thrash metal being the leading scene. The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors.[210] Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with shredding leads. Lyrics often express nihilistic views or deal with social issues using visceral, gory language. Thrash has been described as a form of \"urban blight music\" and \"a palefaced cousin of rap\".[211]\n\nThe subgenre was popularized by the \"Big Four of Thrash\": Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer.[212] Three German bands, Kreator, Sodom and Destruction, played a central role in bringing the style to Europe. Others, including the San Francisco Bay Area's Testament and Exodus, New Jersey's Overkill, and Brazil's Sepultura and Sarc\u00f3fago, also had a significant impact. Although thrash metal began as an underground movement, and remained largely that for almost a decade, the leading bands of the scene began to reach a wider audience. Metallica brought the sound into the top 40 of the Billboard album chart in 1986 with Master of Puppets, the genre's first Platinum record.[213] Two years later, the band's album ...\u00a0And Justice for All hit No. 6, while Megadeth and Anthrax also had top 40 records on the American charts.[214]\n\nThough less commercially successful than the rest of the Big Four, Slayer released one of the genre's definitive records: Reign in Blood (1986) was credited for incorporating heavier guitar timbres and including explicit depictions of death, suffering, violence and occult into thrash metal's lyricism.[215] Slayer attracted a following among far-right skinheads, and accusations of promoting violence and Nazi themes have dogged the band.[216] Even though Slayer did not receive substantial media exposure, their music played a key role in the development of extreme metal.[217]\n\nIn the early 1990s, bands that got their start in thrash metal achieved breakout success, challenging and redefining the metal mainstream.[218] Metallica's self-titled 1991 album topped the Billboard chart,[219] as the band established an international following.[220] Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction (1992) debuted at No. 2,[221] Anthrax and Slayer cracked the top 10,[222] and albums by regional bands such as Testament and Sepultura entered the top 100.[223]\n\nThrash metal soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres. \"Slayer's music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal,\" according to MTV News.[225] The NWOBHM band Venom was also an important progenitor. The death metal movement in both North America and Europe adopted and emphasized the elements of blasphemy and diabolism employed by such acts. Florida's Death, San Francisco Bay Area's Possessed and Ohio's Necrophagia[226] are recognized as seminal bands in the style. All three have been credited with inspiring the subgenre's name. Possessed in particular did so via their 1984 demo, Death Metal, and their song \"Death Metal\", which came from their 1985 debut album, Seven Churches. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish death metal became notable and melodic forms of death metal were created.[227]\n\nDeath metal utilizes the speed and aggression of both thrash and hardcore, fused with lyrics preoccupied with Z-grade slasher movie violence and Satanism.[228] Death metal vocals are typically bleak, involving guttural \"death growls\", high-pitched screaming, the \"death rasp\"[229] and other uncommon techniques.[230] Complementing the deep, aggressive vocal style are down-tuned, heavily distorted guitars[228][229] and extremely fast percussion, often with rapid double bass drumming and \"wall of sound\"\u2013style blast beats. Frequent tempo and time signature changes and syncopation are also typical.[231]\n\nDeath metal, like thrash metal, generally rejects the theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets.[232] One major exception to this rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded an inverted cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery.[232] These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the U.K., the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.[228]\n\nThe first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s, led by the United Kingdom's Venom, Denmark's Mercyful Fate, Switzerland's Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, and Sweden's Bathory. By the late 1980s, Norwegian bands such as Mayhem and Burzum were heading a second wave.[233] Black metal varies considerably in style and production quality, although most bands emphasize shrieked and growled vocals, highly distorted guitars frequently played with rapid tremolo picking, a dark atmosphere[230] and intentionally lo-fi production, often with ambient noise and background hiss.[234]\n\nSatanic themes are common in black metal, though many bands take inspiration from ancient paganism, promoting a return to supposed pre-Christian values.[235] Numerous black metal bands also \"experiment with sounds from all possible forms of metal, folk, classical music, electronica and avant-garde\".[229] Darkthrone drummer Fenriz explained: \"It had something to do with production, lyrics, the way they dressed and a commitment to making ugly, raw, grim stuff. There wasn't a generic sound.\"[236]\n\nAlthough bands such as Sarc\u00f3fago had been donning corpsepaint, by 1990, Mayhem was regularly wearing it; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the Viking metal and folk metal movements, and Immortal brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s,[237] with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.[238]\n\nBy 1992, black metal scenes had begun to emerge in areas outside Scandinavia, including Germany, France and Poland.[239] The 1993 murder of Mayhem's Euronymous by Burzum's Varg Vikernes provoked intensive media coverage.[236] Around 1996, when many in the scene felt the genre was stagnating,[240] several key bands, including Burzum and Finland's Beherit, moved toward an ambient style, while symphonic black metal was explored by Sweden's Tiamat and Switzerland's Samael.[241] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Norway's Dimmu Borgir and England's Cradle of Filth brought black metal closer to the mainstream.[242][243]\n\nDuring the late 1980s, the power metal scene came together largely in reaction to the harshness of death and black metal.[244] Though a relatively underground style in North America, it enjoys wide popularity in Europe, Japan and South America. Power metal focuses on upbeat, epic melodies and themes that \"appeal to the listener's sense of valor and loveliness\".[245] The prototype for the sound was established in the mid- to late 1980s by Germany's Helloween, who, in their 1987 and 1988 Keeper of the Seven Keys albums, combined the power riffs, melodic approach and a high-pitched, \"clean\" singing style of bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden with thrash's speed and energy, \"crystalliz[ing] the sonic ingredients of what is now known as power metal\".[246]\n\nTraditional power metal bands like Sweden's HammerFall, England's DragonForce and the U.S.'s Iced Earth have a sound clearly indebted to the classic NWOBHM style.[247] Many power metal bands such as the U.S.'s Kamelot, Finland's Nightwish, Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica, Italy's Rhapsody of Fire and Russia's Catharsis feature a keyboard-based \"symphonic\" sound, sometimes employing orchestras and opera singers. Power metal has built a strong fanbase in Japan and South America, where bands like Brazil's Angra and Argentina's Rata Blanca are popular.[248]\n\nClosely related to power metal is progressive metal, which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like Rush and King Crimson. This style emerged in the United States in the early and mid-1980s, with innovators such as Queensr\u00ffche, Fates Warning and Dream Theater. The mix of the progressive and power metal sounds is typified by New Jersey's Symphony X, whose guitarist Michael Romeo is among the most recognized of latter-day shredders.[249]\n\nEmerging in the mid-1980s with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal movement rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath.[250] The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal and a number of its subgenres.[251] Doom metal emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos and a sepulchral mood relative to many other varieties of metal.[252]\n\nThe 1991 release of Forest of Equilibrium, the debut album by U.K. band Cathedral, helped spark a new wave of doom metal. During the same period, the doom-death fusion style of British bands Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and Anathema gave rise to European gothic metal.[253] with its signature dual-vocalist arrangements, exemplified by Norway's Theatre of Tragedy and Tristania. New York's Type O Negative introduced an American take on the style.[254]\n\nIn the United States, sludge metal, which mixes doom metal and hardcore punk, emerged in the late 1980s; Eyehategod and Crowbar were leaders in a major Louisiana sludge scene. Early in the next decade, California's Kyuss and Sleep, inspired by the earlier doom metal bands, spearheaded the rise of stoner metal,[255] while Seattle's Earth helped develop the drone metal subgenre.[256] The late 1990s saw new bands form such as the Los Angeles\u2013based Goatsnake, with a classic stoner/doom sound, and Sunn O))), which crosses lines between doom, drone and dark ambient metal; the New York Times has compared their sound to an \"Indian raga in the middle of an earthquake\".[252]\n\nThe era of heavy metal's mainstream dominance in North America came to an end in the early 1990s with the emergence of Nirvana and other grunge bands, signaling the popular breakthrough of alternative rock.[257] Grunge acts were influenced by the heavy metal sound, but rejected the excesses of the more popular metal bands, such as their \"flashy and virtuosic solos\" and \"appearance-driven\" MTV orientation.[206]\n\nGlam metal fell out of favor due not only to the success of grunge,[258] but also because of the growing popularity of the more aggressive sound typified by Metallica and the post-thrash groove metal of Pantera and White Zombie.[259] In 1991, Metallica released their album Metallica, also known as The Black Album, which moved the band's sound out of the thrash metal genre and into standard heavy metal.[260] The album was certified 16\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA.[261] A few new, unambiguously metal bands had commercial success during the first half of the decade \u2013 Pantera's Far Beyond Driven topped the Billboard chart in 1994 \u2013 but, \"In the dull eyes of the mainstream, metal was dead.\"[262] Some bands tried to adapt to the new musical landscape. Metallica revamped its image: the band members cut their hair and, in 1996, headlined the alternative music festival Lollapalooza, which was founded by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell. While this prompted a backlash among some longtime fans,[263] Metallica remained one of the most successful bands in the world into the new century.[264]\n\nLike Jane's Addiction, many of the most popular early 1990s groups with roots in heavy metal fall under the umbrella term \"alternative metal\".[265] Bands in Seattle's grunge scene such as Soundgarden are credited for making a \"place for heavy metal in alternative rock\",[266] and Alice in Chains were at the center of the alternative metal movement. The label was applied to a wide spectrum of other acts that fused metal with different styles: Faith No More combined their alternative rock sound with punk, funk, metal and hip-hop; Primus joined elements of funk, punk, thrash metal and experimental music; Tool mixed metal and progressive rock; bands such as Fear Factory, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails began incorporating metal into their industrial sound (and vice versa); and Marilyn Manson went down a similar route, while also employing shock effects of the sort popularized by Alice Cooper. Alternative metal artists, though they did not represent a cohesive scene, were united by their willingness to experiment with the metal genre and their rejection of glam metal aesthetics (with the stagecraft of Marilyn Manson and White Zombie \u2013 also identified with alt metal \u2013 significant, if partial, exceptions).[265] Alternative metal's mix of styles and sounds represented \"the colorful results of metal opening up to face the outside world\".[267]\n\nIn the mid- and late 1990s came a new wave of U.S. metal groups inspired by the alternative metal bands and their mix of genres.[268] Dubbed \"nu metal\", bands such as Slipknot, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, P.O.D., Korn and Disturbed incorporated elements ranging from death metal to hip-hop, often including DJs and rap-style vocals. The mix demonstrated that \"pancultural metal could pay off\".[269] Nu metal gained mainstream success through heavy MTV rotation and Ozzy Osbourne's 1996 introduction of Ozzfest, which led the media to talk of a resurgence of heavy metal.[270] In 1999, Billboard noted that there were more than 500 specialty metal radio shows in the U.S., nearly three times as many as 10 years before.[271] While nu metal was widely popular, traditional metal fans did not fully embrace the style.[272] By early 2003, the movement's popularity was on the wane, though several nu metal acts such as Korn or Limp Bizkit retained substantial followings.[273]\n\nMetalcore, a hybrid of extreme metal and hardcore punk,[274] emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s, having mostly been an underground phenomenon throughout the 1980s and 1990s;[275] pioneering bands include Earth Crisis,[276][277] Converge,[276] Hatebreed[277][278] and Shai Hulud.[279][280] By 2004, melodic metalcore \u2013 influenced by melodic death metal as well \u2013 was popular enough that Killswitch Engage's The End of Heartache and Shadows Fall's The War Within debuted at No. 21 and No. 20, respectively, on the Billboard album chart.[281]\n\nEvolving even further from metalcore came mathcore, a more rhythmically complicated and progressive style brought to light by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge and Protest the Hero.[282] Mathcore's main defining quality is the use of odd time signatures, and has been described to possess rhythmic comparability to free jazz.[283]\n\nHeavy metal remained popular in the 2000s, particularly in continental Europe. By the new millennium, Scandinavia had emerged as one of the areas producing innovative and successful bands, while Belgium, the Netherlands and especially Germany were the most significant markets.[284] Metal music is more favorably embraced in Scandinavia and Northern Europe than other regions due to social and political openness in these regions;[285] Finland in particular has been often called the \"Promised Land of Heavy Metal\", as there are more than 50 metal bands for every 100,000 inhabitants \u2013 more than any other nation in the world.[286][287] Established continental metal bands that placed multiple albums in the top 20 of the German charts between 2003 and 2008 include Finland's Children of Bodom,[288] Norway's Dimmu Borgir,[289] Germany's Blind Guardian[290] and Sweden's HammerFall.[291]\n\nIn the 2000s, an extreme metal fusion genre known as deathcore emerged. Deathcore incorporates elements of death metal, hardcore punk and metalcore.[292][293] Deathcore features characteristics such as death metal riffs, hardcore punk breakdowns, death growling, \"pig squeal\"-sounding vocals and screaming.[294][295] Deathcore bands include Whitechapel, Suicide Silence, Despised Icon and Carnifex.[296]\n\n\nThe term \"retro-metal\" has been used to describe bands such as Texas-based The Sword, California's High on Fire, Sweden's Witchcraft[297] and Australia's Wolfmother.[297][298] The Sword's Age of Winters (2006) drew heavily on the work of Black Sabbath and Pentagram,[299] Witchcraft added elements of folk rock and psychedelic rock,[300] and Wolfmother's self-titled 2005 debut album had \"Deep Purple-ish organs\" and \"Jimmy Page-worthy chordal riffing\". Mastodon, which plays a progressive/sludge style of metal, has inspired claims of a metal revival in the United States, dubbed by some critics the \"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\".[301]\nBy the early 2010s, metalcore was evolving to more frequently incorporate synthesizers and elements from genres beyond rock and metal. The album Reckless & Relentless by British band Asking Alexandria, which sold 31,000 copies in its first week, and The Devil Wears Prada's 2011 album Dead Throne, which sold 32,400 in its first week,[302] reached No. 9 and No. 10,[303] respectively, on the Billboard 200 chart. In 2013, British band Bring Me the Horizon released their fourth studio album, Sempiternal, to critical acclaim. The album debuted at No. 3 on the U.K. Album Chart and at No. 1 in Australia. The album sold 27,522 copies in the U.S. and charted at No. 11 on the Billboard Chart, making it their highest-charting release in America until their follow-up album, That's the Spirit, which debuted at No. 2 in 2015.\n\nAlso in the 2010s, a metal style called \"djent\" developed as a spinoff of standard progressive metal.[304][305] Djent music uses rhythmic and technical complexity,[306] heavily distorted, palm-muted guitar chords, syncopated riffs[307] and polyrhythms alongside virtuoso soloing.[304] Another typical characteristic is the use of extended range seven-, eight- and nine-string guitars.[308] Djent bands include Periphery, Tesseract[309] and Textures.[310]\n\nFusion of nu metal with electropop by singer-songwriters Poppy, Grimes and Rina Sawayama saw a popular and critical revival of the former genre in the late 2010s and 2020s, particular on their respective albums I Disagree, Miss Anthropocene and Sawayama.[311][312][313][314]\n\nMetal has been recognized as a global music genre, being listened to and performed around the world.[315][316] Laina Dawes explored the multidimensional components of racism in her book What Are You Doing Here?, including the perspectives of black women musicians and fans, in the heavy metal scene in North America and the United Kingdom. She also grounded her doctorial thesis \"'Freedom Ain't Free': Race and Representation(s) in Extreme Heavy Metal\" on her own experiences, laying out some the nuances of a community that can be both a site of exclusionism and at the same time also a place for greater freedom of expression compared to mainstream genres.[317] The band Alien Weaponry from the M\u0101ori people of New Zealand promotes heavy metal music as one way of combating racism.[318]\n\nWomen's involvement in heavy metal began in the 1960s since its very conception, given the role played by Esther \"Jinx\" Dawson, vocalist and leader of Coven.[319][320][321] The next relevant milestone took place in the 1970s when Genesis, the forerunner of Vixen, formed in 1973. A hard rock band featuring all-female members, The Runaways, was founded in 1975; Joan Jett and Lita Ford later had successful solo careers.[322] In 1978, during the rise of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, the band Girlschool was founded and, in 1980, collaborated with Mot\u00f6rhead under the pseudonym Headgirl. Starting in 1982, Doro Pesch, dubbed \"the Metal Queen\", reached success across Europe (making other woman-fronted metal bands to spawn, such as Spain's Santa[323] in 1983), leading the German band Warlock before starting her solo career.[324] In 1983 another pioneering heavy metal singer, Mari Hamada, made her debut, achieving great success in Japan from the 1980s until well into the 21st century.[325] Debuting as the female lead singer of the American band Chastain in 1985, Leather Leone was a pioneer in power metal vocals.[326] In 1986, the German thrash band Holy Moses, fronted by pioneer growler Sabina Classen, issued their first album.[327] Bolt Thrower's bassist Jo Bench since 1987 has inspired female musicians to play metal.[328]\n\nIn 1994, Liv Kristine joined Norwegian gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy, providing \"angelic\"[329] female clean vocals to contrast with male death growls. In 1996, Finnish band Nightwish was founded and featured Tarja Turunen's vocals. This was followed by more women fronting heavy metal bands, such as Halestorm, In This Moment, Within Temptation, Arch Enemy and Epica among others. Liv Kristine was featured on the title track of Cradle of Filth's 2004 album, Nymphetamine, which was nominated for the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.[330]  In 2013, Halestorm won the Grammy in the combined category of Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance for \"Love Bites (So Do I)\".[331] In 2021, In This Moment, Code Orange and Poppy were all nominated in the Best Metal Performance category.[332]\n\nThe most notable of these 1990s/2000s female-fronted groups was the American band Evanescence, headed by vocalist Amy Lee and featuring a musical style usually described as gothic alternative metal and hard rock with classical elements.[333] Their first album Fallen, released in 2003, broke into the popular music scene and was a worldwide phenomenon;[334] it earned the band two Grammy Awards and briefly catapulted Lee to a level of fame similar to that of contemporary popstars such as Christina Aguilera, Avril Lavigne, and Beyonc\u00e9.[335] Although their later albums have not had a similar impact, Evanescence are still one of the most commercially successful metal groups of the 21st century, having sold over 20 million records.[citation needed]\n\nIn Japan, the 2010s saw a boom of all-female metal bands, including Destrose, Aldious, Mary's Blood, Cyntia and Lovebites,[336][337] as well as the mainstream success of Babymetal.[338]\n\nWomen such as Gaby Hoffmann and Sharon Osbourne have held important managerial roles behind the scenes. In 1981, Hoffmann helped Don Dokken acquire his first record deal,[339] as well as became the manager of Accept in 1981 and wrote songs under the pseudonym of \"Deaffy\" for many of band's studio albums. Vocalist Mark Tornillo stated that Hoffmann still had some influence in songwriting on their later albums.[340] Osbourne, the wife and manager of Ozzy Osbourne, founded the Ozzfest music festival and managed several bands, including Mot\u00f6rhead, Coal Chamber, the Smashing Pumpkins, Electric Light Orchestra, Lita Ford and Queen.[341]\n\nThe popular media and academia have long charged heavy metal with sexism and misogyny. In the 1980s, American conservative groups like the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) and the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) co-opted feminist views on anti-woman violence to form attacks on metal's rhetoric and imagery.[342] According to Robert Christgau in 2001, metal, along with hip-hop, have made \"reflexive and violent sexism\u00a0... current in the music\".[343]\n\nIn response to such claims, debates in the metal press have centered on defining and contextualizing sexism. Hill claims that \"understanding what counts as sexism is complex and requires critical work by fans when sexism is normalised.\" Citing her own research, including interviews of British female fans, she found that metal offers them an opportunity to feel liberated and genderless, albeit if assimilated into a culture that is largely neglectful of women.[342]\n\nIn 2018, Metal Hammer editor Eleanor Goodman published an article titled \"Does Metal Have a Sexism Problem?\" interviewing veteran industry people and artists about the plight of women in metal. Some talked about a history of difficulty receiving professional respect from male counterparts. Among those interviewed was Wendy Dio, who had worked in label, booking and legal capacities in the music industry before her marriage to and management of metal artist Ronnie James Dio. She said that after marrying Dio, her professional reputation became reduced to her marital role as his wife, and her competency was questioned. Gloria Cavalera, former manager of Sepultura and wife of the band's former frontman Max Cavalera, said that since 1996, she had received misogynistic hate mail and death threats from fans and that \"women take a lot of crap. This whole #MeToo thing, do they think it just started? That has gone on since the pictures of the cavemen pulling girls by their hair.\"[344]\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerwolf", "content": "\n\nPowerwolf (often stylized in all caps) is a German power metal band founded in 2003 in Saarbr\u00fccken by members of Red Aim. The band consists of vocalist Karsten Brill as \"Attila Dorn\", lead guitarist Benjamin Buss as \"Matthew Greywolf\", bassist/rhythm guitarist David Vogt as \"Charles Greywolf\", keyboardist Christian Jost as \"Falk Maria Schlegel\" and drummer Roel van Helden. The group uses religious themes and images, contrary to traditional power metal music, as well as corpse paint, gothic-tinged compositions and songs about werewolf and vampire legends.\n\nThey released their debut album, Return in Bloodred, in 2005. Their second album, Lupus Dei, was released in 2007. The band entered the official German charts for the first time in 2009 with their third album, Bible of the Beast. Shortly after its release, their first drummer Stefan Gemballa (stage name St\u00e9fane Fun\u00e8bre) left the band. He was replaced by Tom Diener, who was replaced in 2011 by Roel van Helden. In the same year, the band released their fourth album, Blood of the Saints. In 2012, Powerwolf signed with Napalm Records and released Preachers of the Night in 2013. It has debuted at No. 1 in Germany. Their sixth album, Blessed & Possessed, released in 2015, was certified gold in the Czech Republic. Their seventh album, The Sacrament of Sin, was released in 2018. Their eighth album, Call of the Wild, was released in 2021. Their ninth album, Interludium, was released in 2023. Their tenth album, Wake Up the Wicked, was released in 2024.\n\nPowerwolf has embarked on several tours, with a majority of their tour dates taking place inside of Europe. They also change their costumes for every album. Over the years, a theme has developed which personifies the band members as werewolves, leading fans to refer to the band affectionately as \"The Wolves\".\n\nPowerwolf was formed in 2003 by the members of the stoner rock band Red Aim.[1] When the band was founded, the members decided to take on pseudonyms and build up backstories around those.[2]\n\nOfficially, the brothers Charles and Matthew Greywolf had been playing together for years when they decided to create a band, and so Powerwolf was started. Soon the brothers added German drummer St\u00e9fane Fun\u00e8bre and German keyboardist Falk Maria Schlegel to the band, but could not find a suitable singer to complete the line-up. In the meantime, the band started writing, and on holidays in Romania, Charles and Matthew met Attila Dorn in a pub and invited him to join their band.[3] Dorn, a student of classical opera at the academy in Bucharest,[3] moved to the band's hometown Saarbr\u00fccken, and became the frontman of Powerwolf. With Dorn's love of Romanian werewolf legends, the band created their debut album, Return in Bloodred, which used these same legends as the basis for many of the lyrics. After the album's release, Powerwolf went on their first tour titled Europe in Bloodred Tour.[4]\n\nIn 2007, they followed up with their second album, Lupus Dei, a concept album starring a wolf as the main character and his rise from bloodlust to enlightenment.[5][6] Powerwolf supported Grave Digger during their tour.[7]\n\nIn 2008, Powerwolf released their first video album The Wacken Worship. It contained live footage of their show at Wacken Open Air 2008.[8] In the same year, they went on a Metal is our Mission Tour together with Brainstorm and Pagan's Mind.[9]\n\nThe single \"Raise Your Fist, Evangelist\" was released on 19 March 2009.[10] Powerwolf's third album Bible of the Beast was released on 24 April 2009. The record was able to place as the band's first album in the German charts and reached number 76.[11] They embarked on a tour supporting the album in 2010.[12] \"Raise Your Fist, Evangelist\" was nominated for the Metal Hammer \"Metal Anthem 2010\" award.[13]\n\nOn 2 March 2010 St\u00e9fane Fun\u00e8bre left the band and was replaced by Tom Diener. Powerwolf announced it on their Myspace blog.[14]\nIn November 2010, Powerwolf organist Falk Maria Schlegel stated about the group's new material:[15]\n\nWe spent the last three months in the rehearsal room working out stuff for the new album. Even though it's still in the making, we can already promise the songs are 100% POWERWOLF, taking off where Bible of the Beast ended. There's furious stuff, there's epic stuff \u2014 and all of it is catchy as hell.\nOn 28 May 2011 the band announced on their website that Tom Diener was replaced by a new drummer Roel van Helden from the Netherlands.[16]\n\nThe band released the single \"Sanctified with Dynamite\" on 24 May 2011 and the second one on 5 July 2011 titled \"We Drink Your Blood\", to which Powerwolf recorded their first ever music video. It was shot in an ancient monastery church. Falk Maria Schlegel commented that \"Shooting the video in such a special and atmospheric place was incredible. The combination of the sacral interior of the church, including altar, confessional box and a church organ with a lot of fire, fog and metal insanity was the perfect set for a Powerwolf video.\"\n\nTheir fourth album, titled Blood of the Saints, was released on 29 July 2011 in Europe and 2 August in the United States.\n\nIn September 2011, Powerwolf went on a quadruple headline tour with Sabaton, Grave Digger and Skull Fist.[17]\n\nIn 2012, Powerwolf released two albums. The first was the Wolfsn\u00e4chte 2012 Tour EP,[18] a split EP with Mystic Prophecy, Stormwarrior, and Lonewolf. This EP featured a previously unreleased Powerwolf track, \"Living on a Nightmare\". Copies of this EP were originally distributed along with the purchase of tickets to Powerwolf's Wolfsn\u00e4chte Tour 2012[19] but since the tour's conclusion, copies have been available in the Powerwolf webstore.\n\nThe second of Powerwolf's 2012 releases was Alive in the Night, the band's first live album. It contained 10 tracks and was just over 45 minutes in length. It was released with the April 2012 issue of the German edition of Metal Hammer.[20]\n\nOn 13 August 2012, Powerwolf signed a deal with Napalm Records.[21]\nPowerwolf released their EP The Rockhard Sacrament on 22 June 2013. The band also released their single \"Amen & Attack\" on 28 June 2013.[22]\n\nPreachers of the Night was released on 18 July 2013. The album has entered the official German album charts at position 1.[23]\n\nIn 2014, Powerwolf released The History of Heresy I and The History of Heresy II, the second of which included several orchestral versions of Powerwolf songs.[24][25]\n\nPowerwolf began working on their sixth album in June 2014.[26] They announced their new album on their Facebook page on 5 December 2014. On 8 May 2015, the band released their single \"Army of the Night\" and \"Armata Strigoi\" on 5 June 2015. Their new album Blessed & Possessed, which was released on 17 July 2015.[27] They embarked on a tour supporting the album into 2016.[28]\n\nBoxset and earbook editions of the album featured a bonus CD Metallum Nostrum, which contains 10 songs of different artists that Powerwolf's band members selected to cover, such as Judas Priest, Running Wild, Savatage, Chroming Rose, Gary Moore, Ozzy Osbourne, Amon Amarth, Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath.[29]\n\nPowerwolf released their second video album The Metal Mass \u2013 Live on 27 July 2016 in Japan and 29 July 2016 in Europe. It contained live footage of three shows: Masters of Rock 2015, Summer Breeze 2015, Wolfsn\u00e4chte Tour 2015, music videos to \"Amen & Attack\", \"Army of the Night\", \"We Drink Your Blood\" and \"Sanctified with Dynamite\", a festival documentation \"A Day At Summer Breeze\" and a tour documentation movie \"Kreuzweg \u2013 Of Wolves And Men\".[citation needed]\n\nOn 10 October 2017, Powerwolf announced on Facebook that they had completed writing for their seventh full-length album, promising its release to occur sometime in 2018. In January 2018, the band entered the studio to begin recording the album, due later in the year.[30] The title of the album was later announced as The Sacrament of Sin, which was released on 20 July 2018.[31] It was Jens Bogren's first production work for Powerwolf. The album was rated positively by the critics, highlighting mainly the new elements that Powerwolf put in the music. The album also flourished commercially, ranked first in the German charts, and also ranked in several other countries. On 14 September 2018, the album won a German Metal Hammer \"Best album of the year\" award.[32]\n\nA limited edition mediabook version of The Sacrament of Sin featured a second disc named Communio Lupatum, which featured Powerwolf songs covered by other artists selected by the band members, such as Epica, Saltatio Mortis, Caliban, Battle Beast, Heaven Shall Burn, Kadavar, Kissin' Dynamite, Mille Petrozza, Marc G\u00f6rtz, Amaranthe and Eluveitie.[33]\n\nIn support of the album, the band performed in Europe during 2018 and 2019.[34][35]\n\nOn 11 January 2019, Powerwolf re-released their cover album Metallum Nostrum.[36]\n\nOn 1 November 2019, the band released their single of their re-written and re-recorded version of \"Kiss of the Cobra King\".[37][38]\n\nIn 2020, Powerwolf went on their first Latin America tour along with Amon Amarth.[39][40] They had to cancel the last three concerts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[41]\n\nOn 16 January 2020, Powerwolf announced their greatest hits album titled Best of the Blessed.[42][43] Initially set to be released on 5 June 2020, it was later scheduled to be released on 3 July 2020.[citation needed]\n\nOn 28 April 2020, Powerwolf announced work on a new studio album, to be released in 2021.[44][45][46]\n\nOn 19 January 2021, Powerwolf announced their new album will be named Call of the Wild.[47] Later on 20 May 2021, the first song of the album, \"Beast of G\u00e9vaudan\", was released.[48] On 9 June 2021, a re-recorded version of \"Demons Are a Girl's Best Friend\" featuring Alissa White-Gluz on vocals (from Missa Cantorem, the bonus cover album included with various special formats of Call of the Wild) was released.[49] On 23 June, the band released another new song of their new album called \"Dancing with the Dead\".[50]\n\nOn 16 July 2021, Call of the Wild, the band's eighth album, was released.[51]\n\nOn 4 October 2022, the band announced that they are set to perform their first North American shows in New York City and Montreal in February 2023.[52] On 28 November, Powerwolf announced that their ninth studio album, Interludium, would be released on 7 April 2023.[53] On 4 April 2024, Powerwolf announced that their tenth studio album, Wake Up the Wicked, is set for release on 26 July 2024.[54]\n\nPowerwolf's sound has primarily been described as power metal[55][56][57][58][59] and traditional heavy metal.[60][61]\n\nPowerwolf's musical style is different from other power metal bands.[62] In addition to the classic metal instruments, organ sounds are used. For the studio albums, a church choir was recorded.[63] The band states that their main influences are Black Sabbath, Mercyful Fate, Forbidden and Iron Maiden.[64]\n\nThe dominant language of the lyrics is English, but they also use Latin (\"Werewolves of Armenia\", \"Lupus Dei\", \"Kreuzfeuer\", \"Stossgebet\", \"Sanctus Dominus\"), and rarely  German  (\"Moscow After Dark\", \"We Take the Church by Storm\", \"Werewolves of Armenia\", \"Kreuzfeuer\", \"Amen & Attack\", \"Stossgebet\", \"Glaubenskraft\"). The lyrics of the band are characterized by the treatment of Christianity and ancient Romanian legends. Powerwolf, however, do not consider themselves a religious band, but rather call themselves spiritual.[65] When asked if he was a Christian or a Satanist, Matthew Greywolf answered: \"I am a metalist, a metal fan. Metal is my religion. Look at all these people, what unites them? I can tell you, it's the fucking metal.\"[66] In one of the interviews, Matthew is quoted saying:[66]\n\nSome people are confused because we never make a point of saying the silly words of which side we are on. A lot of people ask us, \"Are you Satanists? Are you Christians?\" And we never say anything about that, and we never will, because in what we do in Powerwolf, it's not important what we as individuals believe or stand for. We sometimes describe religious history, we sometimes write about Satanism, Catholicism, or whatever, but we never judge anything. I think on one side, this is confusing people, but on the other side, a lot of people do understand that we only describe or write lyrics about something, not to deliver a message.\nAudience engagement, and pyrotechnics are important parts of Powerwolf's stage show.[67][68] The vocalist Attila Dorn often speaks directly to the audience and engages them in various activities, such as singing or shouting, before announcing the next song.[69] The band calls their concerts a \"heavy metal mass\".[70] Their stage setup was designed by Matthew Greywolf.[62]\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrash_metal", "content": "\n\nThrash metal (or simply thrash) is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its overall aggression and fast tempo.[3] The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead guitar work. \n\nThe genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex guitar stylings of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk and the technicality of progressive music.[4][5][6] Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the conservatism of the Reagan era[7] and the much more moderate, pop-influenced, and widely accessible heavy metal subgenre of glam metal which also developed concurrently in the 1980s.[8] Derived genres include crossover thrash, a fusion of thrash metal and hardcore punk.\n\nThe early thrash metal movement revolved around independent record labels, including Megaforce, Metal Blade, Combat, Roadrunner, and Noise, and the underground tape trading industry in both Europe and North America. The genre was commercially successful from approximately 1985 through 1991, bringing prominence to Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, all grouped together as the \"Big Four\" of U.S. thrash metal.[6][9] Other bands, such as Overkill, Metal Church, and Bay Area acts Exodus, Testament and Death Angel, never achieved the same level of success as the \"Big Four\" but had also developed a strong following in the metal community, through MTV's Headbangers Ball or otherwise.[6][9][10][11] Some of the most popular international thrash metal bands from this era were Brazil's Sepultura, Canada's Voivod, Switzerland's Coroner, England's Onslaught, and the genre's German \"Big Four\": Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, and Tankard.[6][9][11][12]\n\nThe thrash metal genre had declined in popularity by the mid-1990s, due to the commercial success of numerous genres such as alternative rock, grunge, and later pop-punk and nu metal. In response, some bands either disbanded or moved away from their thrash metal roots and more towards groove metal or alternative metal. The genre has seen a resurgence in popularity since the 2000s, with the arrival of various bands such as Bonded by Blood, Evile, Hatchet, Havok, Lamb of God, Municipal Waste, and Warbringer, who have all been credited for leading the so-called \"thrash metal revival\" scene.[13][14][15][16]\n\nThrash metal generally features fast tempos, low-register, complex guitar riffs, high-register guitar solos, and double bass drumming.[17] The rhythm guitar parts are played with heavy distortion and often palm muted to create a tighter and more precise sound.[18] Vocally, thrash metal can employ anything from melodic singing to shouted or screamed vocals. Most guitar solos are played at high speed and technically demanding, as they are usually characterized by shredding, and use advanced techniques such as sweep picking, legato phrasing, alternate picking, tremolo picking, string skipping, and two-hand tapping. \n\nDavid Ellefson, the original bassist of Megadeth, described thrash metal as \"a combination of the attitude from punk rock but the riffs and complexities of traditional metal.\"[19] On the origins of thrash metal, original Anthrax bassist Dan Lilker recalls: \"Thrash was just what they called 'faster hardcore,' because you literally thrashed around when you were either playing it or reacting to it. And thrash metal was born because it was influenced by thrash hardcore, and they just thought it was more metal, so they said, 'Okay, this is thrash metal.'\"[20]\n\nThe guitar riffs often use chromatic scales and emphasize the tritone and diminished intervals, instead of using conventional single-scale-based riffing. For example, the intro riff of Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" (the title track of the namesake album) is a chromatic descent, followed by a chromatic ascent based on the tritone.\n\nSpeed, pacing, and time changes also define thrash metal. Thrash tends to have an accelerating feel which may be due in large part to its aggressive drumming style. For example, drummers often use two bass drums, or a double-bass pedal to create a relentless, driving beat. Cymbal stops/chokes are often used to transition from one riff to another or to precede an acceleration in tempo. Some common characteristics of the genre are fast guitar riffs with aggressive picking styles and fast guitar solos, and extensive use of two bass drums as opposed to the conventional use of only one, typical of most rock music.\n\nTo keep up with the other instruments, many bassists use a plectrum (pick). However, some prominent thrash metal bassists have used their fingers, such as Frank Bello, Greg Christian, Steve Di Giorgio, Robert Trujillo, and Cliff Burton. Several bassists use a distorted bass tone, an approach popularized by Burton and Mot\u00f6rhead's Lemmy. Lyrical themes in thrash metal include warfare, corruption, injustice, murder, suicide, isolation, alienation, addiction, and other maladies that afflict the individual and society. In addition, politics, particularly pessimism and dissatisfaction towards politics, are common themes among thrash metal bands. Humor and irony can occasionally be found (Anthrax for example), but they are limited, and are an exception rather than a rule.[21][22]\n\nThe term proto-thrash has been used to describe bands as having elements of speed metal or thrash metal before those genres came to prominence in early-to-mid-1980s. Deep Purple's 1970 album Deep Purple in Rock is perhaps the earliest proto-thrash/speed metal album, as music journalist Martin Popoff noted, \"It's really about the discipline and classical haughtiness of this record, as well as 'Hard Lovin' Man' which is a great contender for first proto-thrash song ever.\"[9] Queen's 1974 song \"Stone Cold Crazy\" and Black Sabbath's \"Symptom of the Universe\", released the following year, have also been cited as examples of proto-thrash/speed metal; the latter of which was a direct inspiration for Diamond Head's pioneering song \"Am I Evil?\".[23][24] The new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands emerging from Britain in the late 1970s further influenced the development of early thrash. The early work of artists such as Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Mot\u00f6rhead, Tygers of Pan Tang, Raven, and Angel Witch, among others, introduced the fast-paced and intricate musicianship that became core aspects of thrash. Phil Taylor's double-bass drumming featured in Mot\u00f6rhead's 1979 song \"Overkill\" has been acknowledged by many thrash drummers, most notably Lars Ulrich, as a primary influence on their playing. Thrash metal bands have also taken inspiration from Judas Priest, with Slayer guitarist Kerry King saying that, \"There would be no Slayer without Priest.\"[25] Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel played a key role in bringing the NWOBHM to a larger audience, as he was responsible for discovering both Metallica and Slayer and producing their earliest studio recordings.\n\nGreg Prato of Ultimate Guitar notes, \"Although the thrash movement seemed to have much more in common with punk than prog fashion-wise (leather jackets vs. capes), musically, there were certainly moments when thrash leaned more towards the prog side of things.\"[4] Canadian progressive rock band Rush has been cited a formative influence on the thrash metal movement and the birth of its subgenre technical thrash metal (or \"progressive thrash metal\"), which is known for combining traditional thrash metal with elements of progressive, jazz or classical music.[4][5] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante said: \"When I was first learning to play drums, I would strap on my headphones, play along with [Rush's live album All the World's a Stage] and be transformed. I remember talking with Cliff [Burton] and Kirk [Hammett of Metallica] back when we first met, and we all agreed how much of an influence Rush was on all of us.\"[26]\n\nThe thrash metal genre is also strongly influenced by punk rock, drawing inspiration from sources ranging from traditional punk bands from the 1970s, including the New York Dolls, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and the Dead Boys,[27] to late 1970s/early 1980s hardcore punk bands Discharge,[28] GBH,[29] Black Flag,[30] the Misfits, the Dead Kennedys, and Bad Brains.[27] The Ramones' 1976 self-titled debut album in particular has been noted as a key influence on the genre, due to its sound, which introduced the three-chord thrash style of guitar.[31] Void has been credited as one of the earliest examples of hardcore/heavy metal crossover, whose chaotic musical approach is often cited as particularly influential.[32] Their 1982 split LP with fellow Washington band The Faith showed both bands exhibiting quick, fiery, high-speed punk rock. It has been argued that those recordings laid the foundation for early thrash metal, at least in terms of selected tempos,[33] and that thrash is essentially hardcore punk with the technical proficiency missing from that genre. The crossover with hardcore punk has also been cited as important influence on thrash, especially the English hardcore punk band Discharge, whose \"influence on heavy metal is incalculable and metal superstars such as Metallica, Anthrax, Machine Head, Sepultura, Soulfly, Prong and Arch Enemy have covered Discharge's songs in tribute.\"[28] The eponymous debut albums by D.R.I. and Suicidal Tendencies, both released in 1983, have been credited for paving the way for thrashcore.[34][35]\n\nIn Latin America, this genre also gained a lot of strength, and its creation is also attributed to it, since it began to gain popularity due to the dictatorships that many countries faced at that time, with bands like V8 (1979) with their debut albums Demo 1982 or Luchando por el metal,[36] and Bloke (1980)[37] from Argentina, Transmetal (1987) from M\u00e9xico, also the band Massakre (1985) in Chile.\n\nIn Europe, the earliest band of the emerging thrash movement was Venom from Newcastle upon Tyne, formed in 1979. Their 1982 album Black Metal has been cited as a major influence on many subsequent genres and bands in the extreme metal world, such as Bathory, Hellhammer, Slayer, and Mayhem. The European scene was almost exclusively influenced by the most aggressive music Germany and England were producing at the time. British bands such as Tank and Raven, along with German bands Accept (whose 1982 song \"Fast as a Shark\" is often credited as one of the first-ever thrash/speed metal songs)[38][39][40] and Living Death,[41] motivated musicians from central Europe to start bands of their own, eventually producing groups such as Sodom, Kreator, and Destruction from Germany, as well as Switzerland's Celtic Frost (formed by two-thirds of Hellhammer), Coroner and Carrion (who later became Poltergeist) and Denmark's Artillery.\n\nIn 1981, Los Angeles band Leather Charm wrote a song entitled \"Hit the Lights\". Leather Charm soon disbanded and the band's primary songwriter, vocalist/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield, met drummer Lars Ulrich through a classified advertisement. Together, Hetfield and Ulrich formed Metallica, one of the \"Big Four\" thrash bands, with lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, who would later form Megadeth, another of the \"Big Four\" originators of thrash, and bassist Ron McGovney. McGovney would be replaced by Cliff Burton (formerly of Trauma), and Mustaine was later replaced by Kirk Hammett of the then-unsigned Bay Area thrash metal act Exodus, and at Burton's insistence, the band relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area. Before Metallica had even settled on a definitive lineup, Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel asked Hetfield and Ulrich (credited as \"Mettallica\") to record \"Hit the Lights\" for the first edition of his Metal Massacre compilation in 1982. A re-recorded version of \"Hit the Lights\" would later open their first studio album, Kill 'Em All, released in July 1983.[42] Kill 'Em All is widely regarded as the first thrash metal album, and one of the album's tracks \"Whiplash\" has been referred to as one of the first songs of the genre.[43]\n\nThe term \"thrash metal\" was first used in the music press by Kerrang! magazine's journalist Malcolm Dome[44] while referring to another of the \"Big Four\", Anthrax (who, like Metallica, formed in 1981), and their song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\".[45] Before this, Metallica frontman James Hetfield referred to his band's sound as speed metal or power metal.\n\nAnother \"Big Four\" thrash band formed in Los Angeles in 1981, when guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King met while auditioning for the same band and subsequently decided to form a band of their own. Hanneman and King recruited vocalist/bassist Tom Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo, and Slayer was formed. Slayer was discovered by Metal Blade Records executive Brian Slagel; the band's live performance of Iron Maiden's \"Phantom of the Opera\" so impressed him that he promptly signed them to his label. In December 1983, five months after the release of Metallica's debut Kill 'Em All, Slayer released their debut album, Show No Mercy.\n\nTo the north, Canada produced influential thrash and speed metal bands such as Annihilator, Anvil, Exciter, Razor, Sacrifice, and Voivod.\n\nThe popularity of thrash metal increased in 1984 with the release of Metallica's sophomore record Ride the Lightning, as well as Anthrax's debut Fistful of Metal and Metal Church's eponymous debut album.[9] Slayer and Overkill released extended plays on independent labels during this era, Haunting the Chapel and Overkill respectively. This led to a heavier-sounding form of thrash, which was reflected in Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood, Slayer's Hell Awaits and Anthrax's Spreading the Disease, all three released in 1985. Several other debut albums were released that same year, including Megadeth's Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, Overkill's Feel the Fire, Kreator's Endless Pain, Destruction's Infernal Overkill, Possessed's Seven Churches, Celtic Frost's To Mega Therion, Watchtower's Energetic Disassembly and the Sepultura EP Bestial Devastation. Seven Churches and To Mega Therion are often credited for pioneering and popularizing the mid-1980s extreme metal scene (as well as the then-developing genres of death metal and black metal, respectively),[46][47] while Energetic Disassembly has been cited as the first progressive/technical thrash metal album.[48]\n\nFrom a creative standpoint, the year 1986 was perhaps the pinnacle of thrash metal,[citation needed] as a number of critically acclaimed and genre-defining albums were released. Metallica's major label debut Master of Puppets was released in March, becoming the first thrash album to be certified platinum, being certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); it would be the band's last album to feature bassist Cliff Burton, who was killed in a bus accident six months after its release. Kreator released Pleasure to Kill in April 1986, which would later be a major influence on the death metal scene.[49] Megadeth released Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? in September, an album which proved to be the band's commercial and critical breakthrough and which AllMusic later cited as \"a classic of early thrash\".[50] Slayer, regarded as one of the most sinister thrash metal bands of the early 1980s,[51][unreliable source?] released Reign in Blood in October, an album considered by some to have single-handedly inspired the death metal genre.[52] Also in October, Nuclear Assault released their debut album Game Over, followed a month later by Dark Angel's Darkness Descends, which marked the debut of  drummer Gene Hoglan. Flotsam and Jetsam's debut album Doomsday for the Deceiver (released on the Fourth of July in 1986) received some attention as well, due to the album being \"the first of only a handful\" to ever receive a 6K rating from Kerrang! magazine, and it is also notable for featuring a then-unknown Jason Newsted, who, not long after the album's release, joined Metallica as Burton's replacement.[53]\n\nAlso during the mid-to-late 1980s, bands such as Suicidal Tendencies, D.R.I., S.O.D. (who featured three-fifths of Anthrax), and Corrosion of Conformity paved the way to what became known as crossover thrash, a fusion genre that lies on a continuum between heavy metal and hardcore punk, and is arguably faster and more aggressive than thrash metal.[54]\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1980s, thrash metal began to achieve major mainstream success worldwide, with many bands of the genre receiving heavy rotation on MTV's Headbangers Ball,[11][55] and radio stations such as KNAC in Long Beach and Z Rock in Dallas,[56][57] as well as coverage on numerous publications, including Kerrang! and RIP Magazine. These outlets not only played a major role in the crossover success of thrash metal during this time, but helped push album sales of the genre's \"Big Four\" and similar bands or moved them from playing clubs to arenas and stadiums.[58]\n\nAnthrax made its mainstream breakthrough in 1987 with the release of their gold-certified album Among the Living, which borrowed elements from their two previous releases, with fast guitar riffs and pounding drums. Shortly after the release of Among the Living, three Bay Area bands, Testament, Death Angel and Heathen, respectively released their debut albums The Legacy, The Ultra-Violence and Breaking the Silence. All of the \"Big Four\" of Teutonic thrash metal also released albums in 1987: Kreator's Terrible Certainty, Destruction's Release from Agony, Sodom's Persecution Mania and Tankard's Chemical Invasion; those albums cemented their reputations as top-tier German thrash metal bands.[59][60]\n\nIn response to thrash metal's growing popularity during this period, several hardcore punk bands began changing their style to a more heavier direction, including Suicidal Tendencies, who are often considered to be one of the \"fathers of crossover thrash\",[61] and became more recognized as a thrash metal band in the late 1980s (thanks in large part to the presence of guitarists Rocky George and Mike Clark); the band would reach new heights of success with their first two major-label albums, How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today (1988) and Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit... D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (1989).[62] D.R.I.'s music took a similar direction with their last three albums of the 1980s, Crossover (1987), 4 of a Kind (1988), and Thrash Zone (1989),[54] and other bands would follow suit, including The Exploited, Excel (from Suicidal Tendencies' hometown of Venice) and New York hardcore acts M.O.D. (fronted by former S.O.D. singer Billy Milano), the Cro-Mags and the Crumbsuckers.[63][64][65][66][67]\n\nFrom 1987 to 1989, Overkill released Taking Over, Under the Influence, and The Years of Decay, three albums considered their best. Each of the \"Big Four\" of thrash metal bands released albums in 1988: Slayer released South of Heaven, Megadeth released So Far, So Good... So What!, Anthrax released State of Euphoria while Metallica's ...And Justice for All spawned the band's first video and Top 40 hit, the World War I-themed song \"One\". That same year, Metallica joined Van Halen, Scorpions, Dokken and Kingdom Come on the two-month-long arena and stadium tour Monsters of Rock in North America.[68][69] In the spring of 1989, Anthrax teamed up with Exodus and Helloween on a US arena tour sponsored by Headbangers Ball.[55][70]\n\nSepultura's third album, Beneath the Remains (1989), earned them some mainstream appeal as it was released by Roadrunner Records. Testament's second and third albums, The New Order (1988) and Practice What You Preach (1989), nearly gained them the same level of popularity as the \"Big Four\",[71][72] while Exodus' third album Fabulous Disaster (1989) garnered the band their first music video and one of their most recognized songs, the mosh-pit anthem \"The Toxic Waltz\".[73] Vio-lence, Forbidden, and Sadus, three relative latecomers to the Bay Area thrash metal scene, released their debut albums Eternal Nightmare, Forbidden Evil, and Illusions, respectively, in 1988; the latter album demonstrated a sound that was primarily driven by the fretless bass of Steve Di Giorgio. Also in 1988, Blind Illusion released its only studio album for more than two decades, The Sane Asylum, which received some particular attention as it was produced by Kirk Hammett, and is also notable for featuring bassist Les Claypool and former Possessed guitarist Larry LaLonde; after its release, the two would later team up together in Claypool's then-upcoming band Primus.[74][75]\n\nCanadian thrashers Annihilator released their highly technical debut Alice in Hell in 1989, which was praised for its fast riffs and extended guitar solos. In Germany, Sodom released Agent Orange, and Kreator would release Extreme Aggression. Several highly acclaimed albums associated with the sub-genre of technical thrash metal were also released in 1989, including Coroner's No More Color, Dark Angel's Leave Scars, Toxik's Think This, and Watchtower's Control and Resistance, which has been recognized and acknowledged as one of the cornerstones of jazz-metal fusion and a major influence on the technical death metal genre,[76][77] while Forced Entry's debut album Uncertain Future helped pioneer the late 1980s Seattle music scene.[78][79]\n\nA number of more typical but technically sophisticated albums were released in 1990, including Megadeth's Rust in Peace, Anthrax's Persistence of Time, Slayer's Seasons in the Abyss, Suicidal Tendencies' Lights...Camera...Revolution!, Testament's Souls of Black, Kreator's Coma of Souls, Destruction's Cracked Brain, Forbidden's Twisted into Form, Exodus' Impact Is Imminent, Sacred Reich's The American Way, Prong's Beg to Differ, Pantera's Cowboys from Hell and Exhorder's Slaughter in the Vatican; the latter three are often credited for being an integral part of the then-developing groove metal genre.[80][81] All of those albums were commercial high points for the aforementioned artists. During this period, Megadeth and Slayer co-headlined one of the most successful tours in thrash metal history called the Clash of the Titans; the first leg in Europe included support from Testament and Suicidal Tendencies, while the second leg in North America had Anthrax and then-emerging Seattle band Alice in Chains, who were the supporting act.[82][83]\n\nSeveral albums, some of which had come to be known as technical thrash metal, were released in 1991, including Overkill's Horrorscope, Heathen's Victims of Deception, Dark Angel's Time Does Not Heal, Sepultura's Arise, Coroner's Mental Vortex, Prong's Prove You Wrong and Forced Entry's As Above, So Below.\n\nIn 1991, Metallica released their eponymous fifth studio album, known as \"The Black Album\". The album marked a stylistic change in the band, eliminating much of the speed and longer song structures of the band's previous work, and instead focusing on more concise and heavier songs. The album was a change in Metallica's direction from the thrash metal style of the band's previous four studio albums towards a more contemporary heavy metal sound with original hard rock elements, but still had remnant characteristics of thrash metal.[84][85] It would go on to become the band's best-selling album and began a wave of thrash metal bands releasing more garage-oriented albums, or else more experimental ones.\n\nThe era of 1991\u20131992 marked the beginning of the end of thrash metal's commercial peak, due to the rising popularity of the alternative metal and grunge movements (the latter spearheaded by Washington-based bands Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam).[86] In response to this climate change, many thrash metal bands that had emerged from the previous decade had called it quits or went on hiatus during the 1990s, while half of the \"Big Four\" and other veteran bands began changing to more accessible, radio-friendly styles.[87] Metallica was a notable example of this shift, particularly with their mid-to-late 1990s albums Load, and ReLoad, which displayed minor blues and southern rock influences, and were seen as a major departure from the band's earlier sound.[88] Megadeth took a more accessible heavy metal route starting with their 1992 album Countdown to Extinction.[89] Testament, Exodus and Flotsam and Jetsam all took a melodic/progressive approach with the albums The Ritual,[90] Force of Habit,[91] and Cuatro,[92] respectively. One of the pioneers of crossover thrash, Corrosion of Conformity, began changing their sound into a slower and Black Sabbath-influenced heavy metal direction with their post-1980s output, adapting influences and textures of sludge, doom metal, blues, and southern rock on several of their albums, including Blind (1991), Deliverance (1994) and Wiseblood (1996).[93]\n\nIn the wake of the success of groove metal, instigated by Pantera (who went on to become one of the most successful heavy metal bands of the 1990s), several thrash metal established bands started to expand their sound by adding elements and influences from the groove metal genre.[94][95][96] Anthrax, who had recently replaced Joey Belladonna with John Bush as their singer, began stepping away from their previously established thrash metal formula to a more accessible alternative/groove metal approach for the remainder of their 1990s output, starting with and including Sound of White Noise (1993).[97][98][99] Sacred Reich, Overkill, Coroner, Prong, Testament, and Forbidden followed this trend with their respective albums Independent,[100] I Hear Black,[101] Grin,[102] Cleansing,[103] Low,[104] and Distortion.[105] Sepultura's 1993 album Chaos A.D. also marked the beginning of their transition away from death/thrash metal to groove metal which had influenced then-up-and-coming bands like Korn, who reciprocally became the inspiration behind the nu metal style of the band's next album Roots (1996).[106] Roots would influence a generation of bands from Linkin Park to Slipknot, which during the 1990s meant the replacement of death, thrash, and speed, by nu metal and metalcore as popular epicenters of the hardest metal scene.[107]\n\nStaying away from this new commercial mainstream of groove metal, metalcore, and especially nu metal, the second wave of black metal emerged as an opposed underground music scene, initially in Norway. This crop of new bands differenced themselves from the \"first wave\" by totally distilling black metal from the combined origins with thrash metal, but they preserved from all these sub-genres the emphasis on atmosphere over rhythm.[108]\n\nAs further extreme metal genres came to prominence in the 1990s (industrial metal, death metal, and black metal each finding their own fanbase), the heavy metal \"family tree\" soon found itself blending aesthetics and styles.[109] For example, bands with all the musical traits of thrash metal began using death growls, a vocal style borrowed from death metal, while black metal bands often utilized the airy feel of synthesizers, popularized in industrial metal. Today the placing of bands within distinct sub-genres remains a source of contention for heavy metal fans, however, little debate resides over the fact that thrash metal is the sole proprietor of its respective spin-offs.\n\nA few thrash metal bands from the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the genre's U.S. \"Big Four\", continued recording and touring with success in the 2000s. In 2003, Anthrax released their first studio album in five years We've Come for You All, followed a month later by Metallica's double platinum-certified album St. Anger. After experimenting further with a commercialized sound on their previous few albums, Megadeth returned to its heavier sound with their ninth album The World Needs a Hero (2001). It would be the band's final album before disbanding in the following year, due to an arm injury that had left Dave Mustaine unable to play guitar;[110] he would eventually reform Megadeth for a handful albums, including The System Has Failed (2004) which was originally going to be released as a solo album by him,[111] before reuniting with co-founding member and bassist David Ellefson in 2010. Slayer released three albums in the 2000s: God Hates Us All (2001), which saw a return to their signature thrash metal sound,[112] followed by Christ Illusion (2006) and World Painted Blood (2009), both of which marked their first studio albums with drummer Dave Lombardo in nearly two decades. Although their career had declined from its peak in the 1990s, Overkill was perhaps one of the most-active thrash metal groups outside of the \"Big Four\", having never disbanded or taken longer breaks in-between records, and by 2000's Bloodletting, they were the first band in the genre to release more than ten studio albums. Overkill's popularity was reignited in the 2010s, with three of their albums, The Electric Age (2012), White Devil Armory (2014) and The Grinding Wheel (2017), all entering the Top 100 on the Billboard charts.[113][114]\n\nThe resurgence of interest in the thrash metal genre during the early 2000s was widely attributed to the Thrash of the Titans festival, which was held in August 2001 as a co-benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy and Death's Chuck Schuldiner, who were both battling cancer.[10] The show is also notable for seeing several of Testament's Bay Area thrash metal contemporaries, including Exodus, Death Angel, Vio-lence, Forbidden Evil, Sadus and Legacy (a precursor to Testament), reunited.[115][116] Many thrash metal bands from outside of the Bay Area would subsequently reunite, including Anthrax (twice with Joey Belladonna and briefly with John Bush),[117] Dark Angel,[118] Nuclear Assault,[119] Sacred Reich,[120] UK bands Onslaught,[121] Sabbat,[122] and Xentrix,[123] and Canada's Sacrifice,[124] renewing interest in previous decades.\n\nThe term \"thrash-revivalists\" has been applied to such bands as Lamb of God,[16] Municipal Waste,[125] Evile,[13] Havok,[13][14][15] Warbringer,[13][15] Vektor,[15] Bonded by Blood,[15] Hatchet,[13] and Power Trip.[125] Evile's 2007 debut album Enter the Grave, produced by former Metallica producer and engineer Flemming Rasmussen, received considerable praise for its sound, which combined elements of the sounds of Slayer and the Bay Area scene (particularly Exodus and Testament).[126] Los Angeles-based bands Warbringer and Bonded by Blood took a similar approach on their respective debut albums, War Without End and Feed the Beast, both released in 2008.[127][128] Perhaps the most commercially successful band from the 2000s and 2010s thrash metal revival movement is Lamb of God, who are also considered a key part of the new wave of American heavy metal movement,[129][130] have received two gold-certified albums in the U.S.,[131] and continue to play from small clubs to arenas and stadiums.[132]\n\nNotable bands returned to their roots with releases such as Kreator's Violent Revolution (2001), Metallica's Death Magnetic (2008), Megadeth's Endgame (2009), Slayer's World Painted Blood (2009), Exodus' Exhibit B: The Human Condition (2010), Overkill's Ironbound (2010), Anthrax's Worship Music (2011), Testament's Dark Roots of Earth (2012), and Flotsam and Jetsam's Ugly Noise (2012). More recent bands of the genre, such as Havok and Legion of the Damned have turned their focus towards a more aggressive rendition of thrash metal, incorporating elements of melodic death metal.\n\nThrash metal is directly responsible for the development of underground metal genres, such as death metal, black metal,[133] and groove metal.[134] In addition to this, metalcore, grindcore, and deathcore employ similar riffs in their composition, the former with more focus on melody rather than chromaticism. The blending of punk ethos and metal's brutal nature led to even more extreme, underground styles after thrash metal began gaining mild commercial success in the late 1980s.[135]\n\nWith gorier subject matter, heavier down tuning of guitars, more consistent use of blast beat drumming, and darker, atonal death growls, death metal was established in the mid-1980s. Black metal, also related to thrash metal, emerged at the same time, with many black metal bands taking influence from thrash metal bands such as Venom.[136] Black metal continued deviating from thrash metal, often providing more orchestral overtones, open tremolo picking, blast beat drumming, shrieked or raspy vocals and pagan or occult-based aesthetics to distinguish itself from thrash metal. Thrash metal would later combine with its spinoffs, thus giving rise to genres like blackened thrash metal and deathrash.[137][138][139][140]\n\nGroove metal takes the intensity and sonic qualities of thrash metal and plays them at mid-tempo, with most bands making only occasional forays into fast tempo,[134] but since the early 1990s, it started to favor a more death metal-derived sound.[141] Thrash metal with stronger punk elements is called crossover thrash. Its overall sound is more punk-influenced than traditional thrash metal but has more heavy metal elements than hardcore punk and thrashcore.[142]\n\nThrash metal emerged predominantly from a handful of regional scenes, each of which was generally distinguished by the unique characteristics of its bands.\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal", "content": "\n\nDeath metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking; deep growling vocals; aggressive, powerful drumming, featuring double kick and blast beat techniques; minor keys or atonality; abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes; and chromatic chord progressions.[3] The lyrical themes of death metal may include slasher film-style violence,[4] political conflict, religion, nature, philosophy, true crime and science fiction.[5][1][6]\n\nBuilding from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the mid-1980s.[7] Bands such as Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Kreator were important influences on the genre's creation.[8][9][10] Possessed,[11] Death,[12] Necrophagia,[13] Obituary,[14] Autopsy,[15] and Morbid Angel[16] are often considered pioneers of the genre.[3] In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as a popular genre. Niche record labels like Combat, Earache, and Roadrunner began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate.[17]\n\nSince then, death metal has diversified, spawning several subgenres. Melodic death metal combines death metal elements with those of the new wave of British heavy metal. Technical death metal is a complex style, with uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms, and unusual harmonies and melodies. Death-doom combines the deep growled vocals and double-kick drumming of death metal with the slow tempos and melancholic atmosphere of doom metal. Deathgrind, goregrind, and pornogrind mix the complexity of death metal with the intensity, speed, and brevity of grindcore. Deathcore combines death metal with metalcore traits. Death 'n' roll combines death metal's growled vocals and highly distorted, detuned guitar riffs with elements of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal.[18]\n\nEnglish extreme metal band Venom, from Newcastle, crystallized the elements of what later became known as thrash metal, death metal and black metal, with their first two albums Welcome to Hell[19] and Black Metal,[20] released in late 1981 and 1982, respectively. Their dark, blistering sound, harsh vocals, and macabre, proudly Satanic imagery proved a major inspiration for extreme metal bands.[21] Another highly influential band, Slayer, formed in 1981. Although the band was a thrash metal act, Slayer's music was more violent than their thrash contemporaries Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax.[22] Their breakneck speed and instrumental prowess combined with lyrics about death, violence, war, and Satanism won Slayer a cult following.[23] According to Mike McPadden, Hell Awaits, Slayer's second album, \"largely invent[ed] much of the sound and fury that would evolve into death metal.\"[24] According to AllMusic, their third album Reign in Blood inspired the entire death metal genre.[25] It had a big impact on genre leaders such as Death, Obituary, and Morbid Angel.[22]\n\nPossessed, a band that formed in the San Francisco Bay Area during 1983, is described by AllMusic as \"connecting the dots\" between thrash metal and death metal with their 1985 debut album, Seven Churches.[27] While attributed as having a Slayer influence,[28] current and former members of the band had actually cited Venom and Mot\u00f6rhead, as well as early work by Exodus, as the main influences on their sound. Although the group had released only two studio albums and an EP in their formative years, they have been described by music journalists and musicians as either being \"monumental\" in developing the death metal style,[29] or as being the first death metal band.[30][31][32] Earache Records noted that \"the likes of Trey Azagthoth and Morbid Angel based what they were doing in their formative years on the Possessed blueprint laid down on the legendary Seven Churches recording. Possessed arguably did more to further the cause of 'Death Metal' than any of the early acts on the scene back in the mid-late 80's.\"[33]\n\nDuring the same period as the dawn of Possessed, a second influential metal band was formed in Orlando, Florida. Originally called Mantas, Death was formed in 1983 by Chuck Schuldiner, Kam Lee, and Rick Rozz. Inspired by the Brandon, Florida act Nasty Savage, they took the sound of Nasty Savage and deepened it.[34] In 1984, they released their first demo entitled Death by Metal, followed by several more. The tapes circulated through the tape trader world, quickly establishing the band's name. With Death guitarist Schuldiner adopting vocal duties, the band made a major impact in the emerging Florida death metal scene. The fast minor-key riffs and solos were complemented with fast drumming, creating a style that would catch on in tape trading circles.[29] Schuldiner has been credited by AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia for being widely recognized as the \"Father of Death Metal\".[35] Death's 1987 debut release, Scream Bloody Gore, has been described by About.com's Chad Bowar as being the \"evolution from thrash metal to death metal\",[36] and \"the first true death metal record\" by the San Francisco Chronicle.[37] In an Interview Jeff Becerra talked about the discussions of being the creator of the genre, saying that Schuldiner cited Possessed as a massive influence, and Death were even called \"Possessed clones\" early on.[38] Along with Possessed and Death, other pioneers of death metal in the United States include Macabre, Master, Massacre, Immolation, Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, and Post Mortem.[39][40]\n\nBy 1989, many bands had been signed by eager record labels wanting to cash in on the subgenre, including Florida's Obituary, Morbid Angel and Deicide.[41] This collective of death metal bands hailing from Florida are often labeled as \"Florida death metal\". Morbid Angel pushed the genre's limits both musically and lyrically, with the release of their debut album Altars of Madness in 1989.[42][43] The album \"redefined what it meant to be heavy while influencing an upcoming class of brutal death metal.\"[44]\n\nFollowing the original death metal innovators, new subgenres began to develop the end of the decade, such as melodic death metal. Death released their fourth album Human in 1991, which has become a hallmark in technical death metal. Death's founder Schuldiner helped push the boundaries of the genre with uncompromising speed and technical virtuosity, combining intricate rhythm guitar work with complex arrangements and emotive guitar solos.[45]\n\nEarache Records, Relativity Records and Roadrunner Records became the genre's most important labels,[46] with Earache releasing albums by Carcass, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, and Entombed, and Roadrunner releasing albums by Obituary, and Pestilence. Although these labels had not been death metal labels, they initially became the genre's flagship labels at the beginning of the 1990s. In addition to these, other labels formed as well, such as Nuclear Blast, Century Media, and Peaceville. Many of these labels would go on to achieve successes in other genres of metal throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn September 1990, Death's manager Eric Greif held one of the first North American death metal festivals, Day of Death, in Milwaukee suburb Waukesha, Wisconsin, and featured 26 bands including Autopsy, Broken Hope, Hellwitch, Obliveon, Revenant, Viogression, Immolation, Atheist, and Cynic.[47]\n\nDeath metal's popularity achieved its initial peak during 1992\u20131993, with some bands such as Morbid Angel and Cannibal Corpse enjoying mild commercial success. However, the genre as a whole never broke into the mainstream. The genre's mounting popularity may have been partly responsible for a strong rivalry between Norwegian black metal and Swedish death metal scenes. Fenriz of Darkthrone has noted that Norwegian black metal musicians were \"fed up with the whole death metal scene\" at the time. Death metal diversified in the 1990s, spawning a rich variety of subgenres that still have a large \"underground\" following at the present.[48]\n\nIn the 2000s, a number of bands in the hardcore punk scene, including Black Breath and Trap Them began to incorporate elements of death metal into their sound.[49] This was followed by a wave of bands expanding upon the death-doom style of Incantation while incorporating elements of ambient music, including Dead Congregation and Necros Christos.[49]\n\nIn the 2010s, a movement of bands reviving the sound of original 1980s death metal emerged, termed the \"New Wave of Old School Death Metal\".[50] One of the earliest groups in this wave was Horrendous, who formed in 2009,[51] who along with Tomb Mold took a progressive take the genre.[49] Tomb Mold, Necrot, Undergang and Blood Incantation were some of the earliest bands to gain traction in the 2010s, with the COVID-19 pandemic amplifying the amount of attention drawn to the movement, through Cryptic Shift, Slimelord and Vaticinal Rites.[52] In a 2022 article by MetalSucks writer Christopher Krovatin stated \"Right now, as a music journalist, all I hear about is death metal.\"[53] In the UK, this movement became the \"New Wave of British Death Metal\", fronted by Mortuary Spawn, Vacuous and Celestial Sanctuary, this name being coined by Tom Cronin, of Celestial Sanctuary, in order to separate these hardcore-indebted bands from the country's prior movements. The earliest bands in this wave were Cruciamentum and Grave Miasma.[54]\n\nA large part of the New Wave of Old School Death Metal was death metal bands who originated from the hardcore scene, some of which merge elements of hardcore into their style. Xibalba and Fuming Mouth were two of the earliest groups, with the wave being solidified by Gatecreeper, 200 Stab Wounds, Creeping Death,[55] Sanguisugabogg and Kruelty.[56] Venom Prison came from this scene and gained particular attention for their confrontation of what Kerrang! called death metal's \"misogyny problem\", by instead writing \"rape-revenge narrative[s]\".[57] Their lead vocalist Larissa Stupar was described by the publication as \"metal's most important - and uncompromising - voice\".[58]\n\nThe setup most frequently used within the death metal genre is two guitarists, a bass player, a vocalist, and a drummer often using \"hyper double-bass blast beats\".[59][60] Although this is the standard setup, bands have been known to occasionally incorporate other instruments such as electronic keyboards.[61]\n\nDeath metal vocals are referred to as death growls; which are coarse roars/snarls. Death growling is mistakenly thought to be a form of screaming using the lowest vocal register known as vocal fry, however vocal fry is actually a form of overtone screaming, and while growling can be performed this way by experienced vocalists who use the fry screaming technique, \"true\" death growling is in fact created by an altogether different technique.[62] Growling has been called Cookie Monster vocals, tongue-in-cheek, due to the vocal similarity to the voice of the popular Sesame Street character of the same name.[63] Although often criticized, death growls serve the aesthetic purpose of matching death metal's aggressive lyrical content.[64]\n\nThe lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylised violence,[4] but may also extend to topics like religion (sometimes including Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, theology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics.[5] Although violence may be explored in various other genres as well, death metal may elaborate on the details of extreme acts, including blood and gore, psychopathy, delirium, mutilation, mutation, dissection, exorcism, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris commented this apparent glamorisation of violence may be attributed to a \"fascination\" with the human body that all people share to some degree, a fascination that mixes desire and disgust.[20] Heavy metal author Gavin Baddeley also stated there does seem to be a connection between \"how acquainted one is with their own mortality\" and \"how much they crave images of death and violence\" via the media.[65] Additionally, contributing artists to the genre often defend death metal as little more than an extreme form of art and entertainment, similar to horror films in the motion picture industry.[7] This explanation has brought such musicians under fire from activists internationally, who claim that this is often lost on a large number of adolescents, who are left with the glamorisation of such violence without social context or awareness of why such imagery is stimulating.[7]\n\nAccording to Alex Webster, bassist of Cannibal Corpse, \"The gory lyrics are probably not, as much as people say, [what's keeping us] from being mainstream. Like, 'death metal would never go into the mainstream because the lyrics are too gory?' I think it's really the music, because violent entertainment is totally mainstream.\"[66]\n\nThe most popular theory of the subgenre's christening is Possessed's 1984 demo, Death Metal; the song from the eponymous demo would also be featured on the band's 1985 debut album, Seven Churches.[67] Possessed vocalist/bassist Jeff Becerra said he coined the term in early 1983 for a high school English class assignment.[68] Another possible origin was a magazine called Death Metal, started by Thomas Fischer and Martin Ain of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The name was later given to the 1984 compilation Death Metal released by Noise Records.[67] The term might also have originated from other recordings, such as the demo released by Death in 1984, called Death by Metal.[69]\n\nCited examples are not necessarily exclusive to one particular style. Many bands can easily be placed in two or more of the following categories, and a band's specific categorization is often a source of contention due to personal opinion and interpretation. The musical genres in this list are sorted alphabetically.\n\nBlackened death-doom is a microgenre that combines the slow tempos and monolithic drumming of doom metal, the complex and loud riffage of death metal and the shrieking vocals of black metal.[70] Examples of blackened death-doom bands include Morast,[70] Faustcoven,[70] The Ruins of Beverast,[70] B\u00f6lzer,[70] Necros Christos,[70] Harvest Gulgaltha,[71] Dragged into Sunlight,[72] Hands of Thieves,[73] and Soulburn.[74][75]\n\nBlackened death metal is commonly death metal that incorporates musical, lyrical or ideological elements of black metal, such as an increased use of tremolo picking, anti-Christian or Satanic lyrical themes and chord progressions similar to those used in black metal.[76][77][78] Blackened death metal bands are also more likely to wear corpse paint and suits of armour, than bands from other styles of death metal.[79] Lower range guitar tunings, death growls and abrupt tempo changes are common in the genre.[80] Examples of blackened death metal bands are Belphegor,[81] Behemoth,[82] Akercocke,[83] and Sacramentum.[84]\n\nMelodic black-death[85] (also known as blackened melodic death metal or melodic blackened death metal)[86] is a genre of extreme metal that describes the style created when melodic death metal bands began being inspired by black metal and European romanticism. However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre would incorporate an increased sense of melody and narrative.[86] Some bands who have played this style include Dissection,[86][85][87] Sacramentum,[86][85] Naglfar,[86] God Dethroned,[88] Dawn,[86] Unanimated,[86] Thulcandra,[85][86] Skeletonwitch[89] and Cardinal Sin.[85]\n\nWar metal[90][91][92] (also known as war black metal[91] or bestial black metal)[92] is an aggressive,[91] cacophonous[90] and chaotic[90][91] subgenre of blackened death metal,[93] described by Rock Hard journalist Wolf-R\u00fcdiger M\u00fchlmann as \"rabid\"[91] and \"hammering\".[91] Important influences include first wave black metal band Sodom,[90][91] first wave black metal/death metal band Possessed[91] as well as old grindcore, black and death metal bands like Repulsion,[90][91] Autopsy,[91] Sarc\u00f3fago[90][91][92][94] and the first two Sepultura releases.[91][94] War metal bands include Blasphemy,[90][91][94] Archgoat,[91] Impiety,[91] In Battle,[95] Beherit, Crimson Thorn,[96] Bestial Warlust,[97] and Zyklon-B.[98]\n\nBrutal death metal is a subgenre of death metal that privileges heaviness, speed, and complex rhythms over other aspects, such as melody and timbres.[6][99] Brutal death metal bands employ high-speed, palm-muted power chording and single-note riffage.[99] Notable bands include Cannibal Corpse,[100][101] Dying Fetus,[99] Suffocation,[102] Cryptopsy,[103] and Skinless.[104][105]\n\nSlam death metal is a brutal death metal microgenre that evolved from the 1990s New York death metal scene, incorporating elements of hardcore punk.[6][106] In contrast to other death metal styles, it is not generally focused on guitar solos and blast beats; instead, it employs mid-tempo rhythms, breakdowns, and palm-muted riffing, as well as hip hop-inspired vocal and drum beat rhythms.[106] The breakdown riff of Suffocation's \"Liege of Inveracity\" has been credited by Rolling Stone as the first slam riff in death metal.[107] The first wave of bands in the genre were New York bands like Internal Bleeding and Pyrexia,[108][109] with notable subsequent acts including Devourment[110] and Cephalotripsy.[111]\n\nDeath-doom is a style that combines the slow tempos and pessimistic atmosphere of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double-kick drumming of death metal.[112] Influenced mostly by the early work of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, the style emerged during the late 1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s.[112] Death-doom was also pioneered by bands such as Winter,[113] Disembowelment,[113] Paradise Lost,[113] Autopsy, Anathema, and My Dying Bride.[113]\n\nFuneral doom is a genre that crosses death-doom with funeral dirge music.[114] It is played at a very slow tempo, and places an emphasis on evoking a sense of emptiness and despair.[115] Typically, electric guitars are heavily distorted and dark ambient aspects such as keyboards or synthesizers are often used to create a dreamlike atmosphere.[116] Vocals consist of mournful chants or growls and are often in the background.[116] Funeral doom was pioneered by Mournful Congregation (Australia), Esoteric (United Kingdom), Evoken (United States), Funeral (Norway), Thergothon (Finland), and Skepticism (Finland).[117]\n\nDeath 'n' roll is a style that combines death metal's growled vocals and highly distorted detuned guitar riffs along with elements of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal.[18][118] Notable examples include Entombed,[18] Gorefest,[118] and Six Feet Under.\n\nWith the rise in popularity of metalcore, some of its traits have been combined with death metal. Bands such as Suicide Silence, Carnifex and Salt the Wound combine death metal with a variance of metalcore elements.[119] Characteristics of death metal, such as fast drumming (including blast beats), down-tuned guitars, tremolo picking, growled vocals, and high-pitched shrieks are combined with the breakdowns of metalcore. Decibel magazine stated that \"one of Suffocation's trademarks, breakdowns, has spawned an entire metal subgenre: deathcore.\"[120]\n\nGoregrind, deathgrind and pornogrind[122][123] are styles that mix grindcore with death metal, with goregrind focused on themes like gore and forensic pathology,[124] and pornogrind dealing with sexual and pornographic themes.[125][126] Some notable examples of these genres are Brujeria, Cattle Decapitation,[127] Cephalic Carnage, Pig Destroyer,[128] Circle of Dead Children, Rotten Sound, Gut,[129] and Cock and Ball Torture.[130][131]\n\nDeathrash, also known as death-thrash, is a shorthand term to describe bands who play a fusion of death metal and thrash metal.[132][133] The genre gained notoriety in Bali, Indonesia, where it attracted criticism of being related to the accelerated tourism development on the island and the superseding of its local culture, particularly by Jakartan one.[134] Notable bands include Grave,[135] Mortification,[136] The Crown,[133] Incapacity,[133] Darkane,[133] Deathchain,[132] and Sepultura.[137]\n\nIndustrial death metal is a genre of death metal that adds elements of industrial music.[138] Some notable bands include Fear Factory,[139] Anaal Nathrakh,[140][141] Autokrator,[142] and Meathook Seed.[138][143]\n\nSwedish death metal could be considered the forerunner of \"melodic death metal.\" Melodic death metal, occasionally shortened to \"melodeath\", is a fusion of heavy metal with elements of death metal. The subgenre is heavily influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal.[144] Unlike most other death metal, melodeath usually features screams instead of growls, slower tempos, and much stronger emphasis on melody. Clean vocals may be used on occasion. Carcass is sometimes credited with releasing the first melodic death metal album with 1993's Heartwork, although Swedish bands In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, and At the Gates are usually mentioned as the main pioneers of the genre and of the Gothenburg metal sound.\n\nOld school death metal is a style of death metal characterized by its slower and simpler song structures, less focused on the technical aspects of its composition and employing less usage of blast beats.[113] It gained notoriety in the late 1990s, with bands like Repugnant,[145][133] Thanatos,[146] Necrophagia,[113] Abscess,[113] Bloodbath[113] and Mortem.[113]\n\nSymphonic death metal is a genre of death metal that adds elements of classical music. Bands described as symphonic death metal include Fleshgod Apocalypse,[147] Septicflesh,[148] Necronomicon,[149] and Children of Bodom.[150] Haggard's 2000 album, Awaking the Centuries, has been described as death metal-styled symphonic metal.[151]\n\nTechnical death metal (also known as tech-death, progressive death metal, or prog-death)[152] is a subgenre of death metal that employs dynamic song structures, uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms and unusual harmonies and melodies. Bands described as technical death metal or progressive death metal usually fuse common death metal aesthetics with elements of progressive rock, jazz or classical music. While the term technical death metal is sometimes used to describe bands that focus on speed and extremity as well as complexity, the line between progressive and technical death metal is thin. Tech death and prog death, for short, are terms commonly applied to such bands as Nile, Edge of Sanity, and Opeth. Necrophagist and Spawn of Possession are known for a classical music-influenced death metal style. Death metal pioneers Death also refined their style in a more progressive direction in their final years. Some albums for this subgenre are Hallucinations (1990) by the German band Atrocity and Death's Human (1991). This style has significantly influenced many bands, creating a stream that in Europe was carried out at first by bands such as Gory Blister and Electrocution.[153] The Polish band Decapitated gained recognition as one of Europe's primary modern technical death metal acts.[154][155]\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_metal", "content": "\n\nBlack metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms.\n\nVenom initiated the genre's first wave, with their second album Black Metal (1982) giving it its name. In the subsequent years, the style was expanded by Bathory, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. By 1987, this wave had largely declined, however influential works continued to be released by Parabellum, Blasphemy, Sarc\u00f3fago, Tormentor, Samael and Rotting Christ. A second wave arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by bands in the early Norwegian black metal scene scene, such as Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon and Gorgoroth. This wave developed other scenes at the same time in Finland (Beherit, Archgoat, Impaled Nazarene); Sweden (Dissection, Abruptum, Marduk, Nifelheim); the United States (Profanatica, Demoncy, Grand Belial's Key, Judas Iscariot); France (M\u00fctiilation, Vlad Tepes); as well as leading to the formation of influential bands in other countries including Sigh and Cradle of Filth.\n\nInitially a synonym for \"Satanic metal\", black metal has often sparked controversy, due to the actions and ideologies associated with the genre. Some artists express misanthropic views, and others advocate various forms of extreme anti-Christian sentiment, Satanism, or ethnic paganism. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murders. There is also a neo-Nazi movement within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists. Generally, black metal strives to remain an underground phenomenon.\n\nAlthough contemporary black metal typically refers to the Norwegian style with shrieking vocals and raw production, the term has traditionally been applied to bands with widely differing sounds, such as Death SS, Mercyful Fate, Mayhem, Blasphemy,[5][11] and the Greek and Finnish bands that emerged around the same time as the Norwegian scene.[5]\n\nNorwegian-inspired black metal guitarists usually favor high-pitched or trebly guitar tones and heavy distortion.[12] The guitar is usually played with fast, un-muted tremolo picking and power chords.[12][13][14] Guitarists often use dissonance\u2014along with specific scales, intervals and chord progressions\u2014to create a sense of dread. The tritone, or flat-fifth, is often used. Guitar solos and low guitar tunings are rare in black metal.[14] The bass guitar is seldom used to play stand-alone melodies. It is common for the bass to be muted against the guitar,[14] or for it to homophonically follow the low-pitched riffs of the guitar. While electronic keyboards are not a standard instrument, some bands, like Dimmu Borgir, use keyboards \"in the background\" or as \"proper instruments\" for creating atmosphere.[15] Some newer black metal bands began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as synthesizers and even orchestras.\n\nThe drumming is usually fast and relies on double-bass and blast beats to maintain tempos that can sometimes approach 300 beats per minute. These fast tempos require great skill and physical stamina, typified by black metal drummers Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) and Hellhammer (Jan Axel Blomberg).[16] Even still, authenticity is still prioritized over technique. \"This professionalism has to go,\" insists well-respected drummer and metal historian Fenriz (Gylve Fenris Nagell) of Darkthrone. \"I want to de-learn playing drums, I want to play primitive and simple, I don't want to play like a drum solo all the time and make these complicated riffs\".[17]\n\nBlack metal songs often stray from conventional song structure and often lack clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections. The Greek style\u2014established by Rotting Christ, Necromantia and Varathron[18]\u2014has more death metal traits than Norwegian black metal.[8]\n\nTraditional black metal bands tend to favor raspy, high-pitched vocals which include techniques such as shrieking, screaming, and snarling,[12][14] a vocal style influenced by Quorthon of Bathory.[20] Death growls, common in the death metal genre, are sometimes used, but less frequently than the characteristic black metal shriek.[21][22]\n\nBlack metal lyrics typically attack Christianity and the other institutional religions,[14] often using apocalyptic language and evoking anti-authoritarianism and anti-establishment messages against religious governments and societies.[23] Satanic lyrics are common,[24] and many see them as essential to black metal. For Satanist black metal artists, \"Black metal songs are meant to be like Calvinist sermons; deadly serious attempts to unite the true believers\".[25] Misanthropy, global catastrophe, war, death, destruction and rebirth are also common themes.[24] Another topic often found in black metal lyrics is that of the wild and extreme aspects and phenomena of the natural world, particularly the wilderness, forests, mountains, winter, storms, and blizzards.[26] Black metal also has a fascination with the distant past. Many bands write about the mythology and folklore[27] of their homelands and promote a revival of pre-Christian, pagan traditions. A significant number of bands write lyrics only in their native language and a few (e.g. Arckanum and early Ulver) have lyrics in archaic languages. Some doom metal-influenced artists' lyrics focus on depression, nihilism, introspection, self-harm and suicide.[28][29][30]\n\nMany bands choose not to play live.[31][32] Many of those who do play live maintain that their performances \"are not for entertainment or spectacle. Sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else\".[33] Some bands consider their concerts to be rituals[33] and often make use of stage props and theatrics. Bands such as Mayhem, Gorgoroth, and Watain are noted for their controversial shows, which have featured impaled animal heads, mock crucifixions, medieval weaponry and band members doused in animal blood.[34] A few vocalists, such as Dead, Maniac and Kvarforth, are known for cutting themselves while singing onstage.\n\nBlack metal artists often appear dressed in black with combat boots, bullet belts, spiked wristbands[24] and inverted crosses and inverted pentagrams to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance.[35] However, the most stand-out trait is their use of corpse paint\u2014black and white face paint sometimes mixed with real or fake blood, which is used to create a corpse-like or demonic appearance.\n\nThe imagery of black metal reflects its lyrics and ideology. In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring xeroxed black-and-white pictures and/or writing.[5] This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.[5] Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example Burzum's Filosofem and Emperor's In the Nightside Eclipse) while others are violent, sexually transgressive, sacrilegious, or iconoclastic (for example Marduk's Fuck Me Jesus and Dimmu Borgir's In Sorte Diaboli).\n\nThe earliest black metal artists had very limited resources, which meant that recordings were often made in homes or basements,[12] giving their recordings a distinctive \"lo-fi\" quality. However, even when success allowed access to professional studios, many artists instead chose to continue making lo-fi recordings.[14][24] Artists believed that by doing so, they would both stay true to the genre's underground roots as well as make the music sound more \"raw\" or \"cold\".[24] A well-known example of this approach is on the album Transilvanian Hunger by Darkthrone, a band who Johnathan Selzer of Terrorizer magazine says \"represent the DIY aspect of black metal.\"[24] In addition, lo-fi production was used to keep black metal inaccessible or unappealing to mainstream music fans and those who are not committed. Many have claimed that black metal was originally intended only for those who were part of the scene and not for a wider audience.[24] Vocalist Gaahl said that during its early years, \"Black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction\".[13]\n\nOccult and Satanic lyrical themes were present in the music of heavy metal and rock bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s such as Black Sabbath and Coven.[36]\n\nIn the late 1970s, the form of rough and aggressive heavy metal played by the British band Mot\u00f6rhead gained popularity.[36] Many first wave black metal bands cited Mot\u00f6rhead as an influence.[36] Also popular in the late 1970s, punk rock came to influence the birth of black metal.[36] Tom G. Warrior of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost credited English punk group Discharge as \"a revolution, much like Venom\", saying, \"When I heard the first two Discharge records, I was blown away. I was just starting to play an instrument and I had no idea you could go so far.\"[37]\n\nThe use of corpse paint in the black metal imagery was mainly influenced by the American 1970s rock band Kiss.[36]\n\nThe term \"black metal\" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album Black Metal (1982).[24] Playing a style bordering speed metal or thrash metal, the album initiated the first wave of black metal, forming an early prototype for the genre.[35][38] The band introduced many tropes that became ubiquitous in the genre, such as blasphemous lyrics and imagery, as well as stage names, costumes and face paint meant to strike fear.[39] During this first wave of bands, distinct borders of the genre had not been set, instead, black metal bands existed in a broader extreme metal umbrella alongside the earliest groups in death metal, grindcore and thrash metal.[40]\n\nHellhammer, from Switzerland, \"made truly raw and brutal music\"[41] with Satanic lyrics, and became an important influence on later black metal;[42] \"Their simple yet effective riffs and fast guitar sound were groundbreaking, anticipating the later trademark sound of early Swedish death metal\".[41] In 1984, members of Hellhammer formed Celtic Frost,[43] whose music \"explored more orchestral and experimental territories. The lyrics also became more personal, with topics about inner feelings and majestic stories. But for a couple of years, Celtic Frost was one of the world's most extreme and original metal bands, with a huge impact on the mid-1990s black metal scene\".[41]\n\nAnother influential early band was Bathory from Sweden. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (a.k.a. Quorthon), created \"the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal\".[44] Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the shrieked vocals that later became a common trait.[20] Their third album Under the Sign of the Black Mark (1987) was the first record in the genre to subvert most traditional rock tropes, in a way that led journalist Dayal Patterson that \"undoubtedly... create[d] the black metal sound as we know it\".[45]\n\nThe Danish band Mercyful Fate influenced the Norwegian scene with their imagery and lyrics.[46][47][48] Frontman King Diamond, who wore ghoulish black-and-white facepaint on stage, may be one of the inspirators of what became known as 'corpse paint'.[49] Other artists that were a part of this wave included Germany's Kreator, Sodom and Destruction (from Germany),[50] Italy's Bulldozer and Death SS,[11] Japan's Sabbat[51] and Colombia's Parabellum.[52]\n\nIn 1987, in the fifth issue of his Slayer fanzine, Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen wrote that \"the latest fad of black/Satanic bands seems to be over\", citing United States bands Incubus and Morbid Angel, as well as Sabbat from Great Britain as some of the few continuing the genre.[53] However, black metal continued in the underground, with scenes developing in Brazil with Sepultura, Vulcano,[54] Holocausto[55] and Sarc\u00f3fago,[56] Czechoslovakia with Root, T\u00f6rr and Master's Hammer,[57] and Sweden with Grotesque,[58][59] Merciless, Mefisto,[60] Tiamat[58][61] and Morbid.[62] Sarc\u00f3fago's debut album I.N.R.I. (1987), was widely influential on subsequent acts in the genre, especially the second wave Norwegian scene[56] and groups in the war metal style.[63][64][65] BrooklynVegan writer Kim Kelly calling it \"a gigantic influence on black metal\u2019s sound, aesthetics, and attitude.\"[66] Furthermore, during this time other influential records in the genre were released by Von (from the United States),[67] Rotting Christ (from Greece),[68] Tormentor (from Hungary),[54] Mortuary Drape (from Italy),[69] Kat (from Poland),[54] Samael (from Switzerland)[70] and Blasphemy (from Canada).[63] Blasphemy's debut album Fallen Angel of Doom (1990) is considered one of the most influential records for the war metal style.[63][64][65] Fenriz of the Norwegian band Darkthrone called Master's Hammer's debut album Ritual \"the first Norwegian black metal album, even though they are from Czechoslovakia\".[71] It was only during this post\u20131987 era of bands that the various extreme metal styles began to develop definitions distinct from one another, and the borders of what now consistues black metal were drawn.[40]\n\nThe second wave of black metal began in 1991, with Rock Hard magazine crediting Samael's Worship Him (1 April 1991) as its beginnings,[72] while, Metal Hammer writer Enrico Ahlig cited it as beginning with the 8 April 1991 suicide of Mayhem vocalist Dead.[73]\n\nDuring 1990\u20131993, a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music; this included Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum, Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon, Enslaved, Thorns, and Gorgoroth. They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch and \u00d8ystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth.[5][13] Fenriz of Darkthrone described it as being \"derived from Bathory\"[74] and noted that \"those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s\".[75]\n\nThe wearing of corpse paint became standard, and was a way for many black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the era.[24] The scene also had an ideology and ethos. Artists were bitterly opposed to Christianity and presented themselves as misanthropic Devil worshippers who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil.[76] They professed to be serious in their views and vowed to act on them. Ihsahn of Emperor said that they sought to \"create fear among people\"[77] and \"be in opposition to society\".[78] The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those who were \"true\" and attempting to expel all \"poseurs\".[79] Some members of the scene were responsible for a spate of church burnings and murder, which eventually drew attention to it and led to a number of artists being imprisoned.\n\nOn 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist Per \"Dead\" Ohlin committed suicide while left alone in a house shared by the band.[80][81] Fellow musicians described Dead as odd, introverted and depressed. Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, said that Dead was the first to wear the distinctive corpse paint that became widespread in the scene.[82] He was found with slit wrists and a shotgun wound to the head. Dead's suicide note began with \"Excuse all the blood\", and apologized for firing the weapon indoors.[81][83] Before calling the police, Euronymous got a disposable camera and photographed the body,[84] after re-arranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album, Dawn of the Black Hearts.[82]\n\nEuronymous made necklaces with bits of Dead's skull and gave some to musicians he deemed worthy.[35] Rumors also spread that he had made a stew with bits of his brain.[24][80] Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's evil image and claimed Dead had killed himself because extreme metal had become trendy and commercialized.[85] Mayhem bassist J\u00f8rn 'Necrobutcher' Stubberud noted that \"people became more aware of the black metal scene after Dead had shot himself ... I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene\".[86]\n\nTwo other members of the early Norwegian scene later committed suicide: Erik 'Grim' Br\u00f8dreskift (of Immortal, Borknagar, Gorgoroth) in 1999[87][88] and Espen 'Storm' Andersen (of Strid) in 2001.[89]\n\nDuring May\u2013June 1991,[90] Euronymous of Mayhem opened an independent record shop named \"Helvete\" (Norwegian for \"Hell\") at Schweigaards gate 56 in Oslo. It quickly became the focal point of Norway's emerging black metal scene and a meeting place for many of its musicians; especially the members of Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns.[91] Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen, writer of the fanzine Slayer, said that the opening of Helvete was \"the creation of the whole Norwegian black metal scene\".[92] In its basement, Euronymous founded an independent record label named Deathlike Silence Productions. With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Euronymous's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels, who had previously shunned black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.\n\nIn 1992, members of the Norwegian black metal scene began a wave of arson attacks on Christian churches. By 1996, there had been at least 50 such attacks in Norway.[91] Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. The first to be burnt down was Norway's Fantoft Stave Church. Police believe Varg Vikernes of Burzum was responsible.[91] The cover of Burzum's EP Aske (\"ashes\") is a photograph of the destroyed church.[93] In May 1994, Vikernes was found guilty for burning down the Holmenkollen Chapel, Skjold Church, and \u00c5sane Church.[74][94] In addition, he was found guilty for an attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150\u00a0kg of explosives.[95] To coincide with the release of Mayhem's De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, Vikernes and Euronymous had also allegedly plotted to bomb the Nidaros Cathedral, which appears on the album cover. The musicians Faust,[96] Samoth,[95] (both of Emperor), and J\u00f8rn Inge Tunsberg (of Hades Almighty)[95][91] were also convicted for church arsons. Members of the Swedish black metal scene started to burn churches as well in 1993.[97]\n\nThose convicted for church burnings showed no remorse and described their actions as a symbolic \"retaliation\" against Christianity in Norway.[98] Mayhem drummer Hellhammer said he had called for attacks on mosques and Hindu temples, on the basis that they were more foreign.[99] Today, opinions on the church burnings differ within the black metal community. Many musicians, singers, and songwriters in the early Norwegian black metal scene, such as Infernus and Gaahl of Gorgoroth, continue to praise the church burnings, with the latter saying \"there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them\".[35] Others, such as Necrobutcher and Kjetil Manheim of Mayhem and Abbath of Immortal,[35] see the church burnings as having been futile. Manheim claimed that many arsons were \"just people trying to gain acceptance\" within the black metal scene.[80] Watain vocalist Erik Danielsson respected the attacks, but said of those responsible: \"the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course\".[100]\n\nIn early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes.[101] On the night of 10 August 1993, Varg Vikernes (of Burzum) and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch (of Thorns) drove from Bergen to Euronymous's apartment in Oslo. When they arrived a confrontation began and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds\u2014two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.[102]\n\nIt has been speculated that the murder was the result of either a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records or an attempt at outdoing a stabbing in Lillehammer the year before by Faust.[103] Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death while videotaping the event.[74] He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned contract to ambush him.[74][104] Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract that night and \"tell him to fuck off\", but that Euronymous panicked and attacked him first.[104] He also claims that most of the cuts were from broken glass Euronymous had fallen on during the struggle.[104] The self-defense story is doubted by Faust,[105] while Necrobutcher confirmed that Vikernes killed Euronymous in self-defense due to the death threats he received from him.[106]\n\nVikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993, in Bergen.[107] Many other members of the scene were taken in for questioning around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and for possession of 150\u00a0kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, \"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\".[95] Vikernes smiled when his verdict was read and the picture was widely reprinted in the news media. Blackthorn was sentenced to eight years in prison for being an accomplice to the murder.[95] That month saw the release of Mayhem's album De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, which featured Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.[13] Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes, but Hellhammer said: \"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts. But I never did\".[13] In 2003, Vikernes failed to return to T\u00f8nsberg prison after being given a short leave. He was re-arrested shortly after while driving a stolen car with various weapons.[108] Vikernes was released on parole in 2009.[109][110]\n\nJapanese band Sigh formed in 1990 and was in regular contact with key members of the Norwegian scene. Their debut album, Scorn Defeat, became \"a cult classic in the black metal world\".[111]\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, Northern European metal acts began to release music influenced by these bands or the older ones from the first wave. In Sweden, this included Dissection,[112] Abruptum,[112][113] Marduk,[112][114][115] and Nifelheim.[112] In Finland, there emerged a scene that mixed the first wave black metal style with elements of death metal and grindcore; this included Beherit, Archgoat and Impaled Nazarene, whose debut album Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz Rock Hard journalist Wolf-R\u00fcdiger M\u00fchlmann considers a part of war metal's roots.[116] Bands such as Demoncy and Profanatica emerged during this time in the United States, when death metal was more popular among extreme metal fans. The Norwegian band Mayhem's concert in Leipzig with Eminenz and Manos in 1990, later released as Live in Leipzig, was said to have had a strong influence on the East German scene[117] and is even called the unofficial beginning of German black metal.[118]\n\nBlack metal scenes also emerged on the European mainland during the early 1990s, inspired by the Norwegian scene or the older bands, or both. In Poland, a scene was spearheaded by Graveland and Behemoth. In France, a close-knit group of musicians known as Les L\u00e9gions Noires emerged; this included artists such as M\u00fctiilation, Vlad Tepes, Belketre and Torgeist. In Belgium, there were acts such as Ancient Rites and Enthroned. Bands such as Black Funeral, Grand Belial's Key and Judas Iscariot emerged during this time in the United States. Black Funeral, from Houston, formed in 1993, was associated with black magic and Satanism.[119]\n\nA notable black metal group in England was Cradle of Filth, who released three demos in a black/death metal style with symphonic flourishes, followed by the album The Principle of Evil Made Flesh, which featured a then-unusual hybrid style of black and gothic metal. The band then abandoned black metal for gothic metal,[120] becoming one of the most successful extreme metal bands to date. John Serba of AllMusic commented that their first album \"made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads' tongues, whether in praise of the band's brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its 'commercialization' of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage\".[121] Some black metal fans did not consider Cradle of Filth to be black metal. When asked if he considers Cradle of Filth a black metal band, vocalist Dani Filth said he considers them black metal in terms of philosophy and atmosphere, but not in other ways.[122] Another English band called Necropolis never released any music, but \"began a desecratory assault against churches and cemeteries in their area\" and \"almost caused Black Metal to be banned in Britain as a result\".[123] Dayal Patterson says successful acts like Cradle of Filth \"provoked an even greater extremity [of negative opinion] from the underground\" scene due to concerns about \"selling out\".[124]\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Thuringian band Absurd drew attention to the German black metal scene. In 1993, the members murdered a boy from their school, Sandro Beyer.[125] A photo of Beyer's gravestone is on the cover of one of their demos,[126] Thuringian Pagan Madness, along with pro-Nazi statements. It was recorded in prison and released in Poland by Graveland drummer Capricornus.[127] The band's early music was more influenced by Oi! and Rock Against Communism (RAC) than by black metal,[128] and described as being \"more akin to '60s garage punk than some of the [\u2026] Black Metal of their contemporaries\".[129] Alexander von Meilenwald from German band Nagelfar considers Ungod's 1993 debut Circle of the Seven Infernal Pacts, Desaster's 1994 demo Lost in the Ages, Tha-Norr's 1995 album Wolfenzeitalter, Lunar Aurora's 1996 debut Welteng\u00e4nger and Katharsis's 2000 debut 666[130] to be the most important recordings for the German scene.[117] He said they were \"not necessarily the best German releases, but they all kicked off something\".[117]\n\nIn the beginning of the second wave, the different scenes developed their own styles; as Alan 'Nemtheanga' Averill says, \"you had the Greek sound and the Finnish sound, and the Norwegian sound, and there was German bands and Swiss bands and that kind of thing.\"[5] By the mid-1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands worldwide, and in 1998, Kerrang! journalist Malcolm Dome said that \"black metal as we know it in 1998 owes more to Norway and to Scandinavia than any other particular country\".[91] Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as synthesizers and even full-symphony orchestras. By the late 1990s, the underground concluded that several of the Norwegian pioneers\u2014like Emperor,[64][132] Immortal,[64][132] Dimmu Borgir,[132] Ancient,[64][132] Covenant/The Kovenant,[132] and Satyricon[64]\u2014had commercialized[64][132] or sold out to the mainstream and \"big bastard labels.\"[132] Dayal Patterson states that successful acts like Dimmu Borgir \"provoked and even greater extremity [of negative opinion] from the underground\" regarding the view that these bands had \"sold out.\"[124]\n\nAfter Euronymous's death, \"some bands went more towards the Viking metal and epic style, while some bands went deeper into the abyss.\"[100] Since 1993, the Swedish scene had carried out church burnings, grave desecration, and other violent acts. In 1995, Jon N\u00f6dtveidt of Dissection joined the Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO).[133] In 1997, he and another MLO member were arrested and charged with shooting dead a 37-year-old man. It was said he was killed \"out of anger\" because he had \"harassed\" the two men. N\u00f6dtveidt received a 10-year sentence.[134] As the victim was a homosexual immigrant, Dissection was accused of being a Nazi band,[135] but N\u00f6dtveidt denied this and dismissed racism and nationalism.[135][136]\n\nThe Swedish band Shining, founded in 1996, began writing music almost exclusively about depression and suicide, musically inspired by Strid and by Burzum's albums Hvis lyset tar oss and Filosofem.[137] Vocalist Niklas Kvarforth wanted to \"force-feed\" his listeners \"with self-destructive and suicidal imagery and lyrics.\"[100] In the beginning, he used the term \"suicidal black metal\" for his music.[100][138] However, he stopped using the term in 2001 because it had begun to be used by a slew of other bands, whom he felt had misinterpreted his vision[100][138] and were using the music as a kind of therapy[100][138] rather than a weapon against the listener as Kvarforth intended.[138] He said that he \"wouldn't call Shining a black metal band\" and called the \"suicidal black metal\" term a \"foolish idea.\"[100]\n\nAccording to Erik Danielsson, when his band Watain formed in 1998, there were very few bands who took black metal as seriously as the early Norwegian scene had.[100] A newer generation of Swedish Satanic bands like Watain and Ondskapt, inspired by Ofermod,[139][140] the new band of Nefandus member Belfagor, put this scene \"into a new light.\" Kvarforth said, \"It seems like people actually [got] afraid again.\"[100] \"The current Swedish black metal scene has a particularly ambitious and articulate understanding of mysticism and its validity to black metal. Many Swedish black metal bands, most notably Watain and Dissection, are [or were] affiliated with the Temple of the Black Light, or Misanthropic Luciferian Order [\u2026] a Theistic, Gnostic, Satanic organization based in Sweden\".[141] Upon his release in 2004, Jon N\u00f6dtveidt restarted Dissection with new members whom he felt were able to \"stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's Satanic concept.\"[142] He started calling Dissection \"the sonic propaganda unit of the MLO\"[143][144] and released a third full-length album, Reinkaos. The lyrics contain magical formulae from the Liber Azerate and are based on the organization's teachings.[145] After the album's release and a few concerts, N\u00f6dtveidt said that he had \"reached the limitations of music as a tool for expressing what I want to express, for myself and the handful of others that I care about\" and disbanded Dissection[144] before dying by suicide.[146]\n\nA part of the underground scene adopted a Jungian interpretation of the church burnings and other acts of the early scene as the re-emergence of ancient archetypes, which Kadmon of Allerseelen and the authors of Lords of Chaos had implied in their writings.[147][148] They mixed this interpretation with Paganism and Nationalism.[148] Varg Vikernes was seen as \"an ideological messiah\" by some,[149] although Vikernes had disassociated himself from black metal[149][150] and his neo-Nazism had nothing to do with that subculture.[150] This led to the rise of National Socialist black metal (NSBM), which Hendrik M\u00f6bus of Absurd calls \"the logical conclusion\" of the Norwegian black metal \"movement\".[148] Other parts of the scene oppose NSBM as it is \"indelibly linked with As\u00e1 Tr\u016d and opposed to Satanism\", or look upon Nazism \"with vague skepticism and indifference\".[151] Members of the NSBM scene, among others, see the Norwegian bands as poseurs whose \"ideology is cheap\", although they still respect Vikernes and Burzum, whom Grand Belial's Key vocalist Richard Mills called \"the only Norwegian band that remains unapologetic and literally convicted of his beliefs.\"[149]\n\nIn France, besides Les L\u00e9gions Noires (The Black Legions), an NSBM scene arose. Members of French band Funeral desecrated a grave in Toulon in June 1996, and a 19-year-old black metal fan stabbed a priest to death in Mulhouse on Christmas Eve 1996.[152] According to MkM of Antaeus and Aosoth, the early French scene \"was quite easy to divide: either you were NSBM, and you had the support from zine and the audience, or you were part of the black legions, and you had that 'cult' aura\", whereas his band Antaeus, not belonging to either of these sub-scenes, \"did not fit anywhere.\"[153] Many French bands, like Deathspell Omega and Aosoth, have an avantgarde approach[154] and a disharmonic sound that is representative of that scene.[155]\n\nThe early American black metal bands remained underground. Some of them\u2014like Grand Belial's Key and Judas Iscariot\u2014joined an international NSBM organization called the Pagan Front, although Judas Iscariot's sole member Akhenaten left the organization.[156] Other bands like Averse Sefira never had any link with Nazism.[156] The US bands have no common style. Many were musically inspired by Burzum but did not necessarily adopt Vikernes's ideas.[156] Profanatica's music is close to death metal,[157] while Demoncy were accused of ripping off Gorgoroth riffs.[158] There also emerged bands like Xasthur and Leviathan[32] (whose music is inspired by Burzum[156] and whose lyrics focus on topics such as depression and suicide),[159][160] Nachtmystium,[32] Krallice,[32][161] Wolves in the Throne Room[32][161] (a band linked to the crust punk scene and the environmental movement),[162][163] and Liturgy (the style of whom frontwoman Hunter Hunt-Hendrix describes as 'transcendental black metal').[32][164] These bands eschew black metal's traditional lyrical content for \"something more Whitman-esque\"[32] and have been rejected by some traditional black-metallers for their ideologies[165] and the post-rock and shoegazing influences some of them have adopted.[161] Also, some bands like Agalloch started to incorporate \"doom and folk elements into the traditional blast-beat and tremolo-picking of the Scandinavian incarnation\", a style that later became known as Cascadian black metal, in reference to the region where it emerged.[166]\n\nIn Australia, a scene led by bands like Destr\u00f6yer 666, Vomitor, Hobbs' Angel of Death, Nocturnal Graves and Gospel of the Horns arose. This scene's typical style is a mixture of old school black metal and raw thrash metal influenced by old Celtic Frost, Bathory, Venom, and Sodom but also with its own elements.[167]\n\nMelechesh was formed in Jerusalem in 1993, \"the first overtly anti-Christian band to exist in one of the holiest cities in the world\".[168] Melechesh began as a straightforward black metal act with their first foray into folk metal occurring on their 1996 EP The Siege of Lachish.[169] Their subsequent albums straddled black, death, and thrash metal.[170] Another band, Arallu, was formed in the late 1990s and has relationships with Melechesh and Salem.[171][172] Melechesh and Arallu perform a style they call \"Mesopotamian Black Metal\", a blend of black metal and Mesopotamian folk music.[168][172]\n\nSince the 2000s, a number of anti-Islamic and anti-religious black metal bands\u2014whose members come from Muslim backgrounds\u2014have emerged in the Middle East. Janaza, believed to be Iraq's first female black metal artist, released the demo Burning Quran Ceremony in 2010. Its frontwoman, Anahita, claimed her parents and brother were killed by a suicide bomb during the Iraq War. Another Iraqi band, Seeds of Iblis, also fronted by Anahita,[173] released their debut EP Jihad Against Islam in 2011 through French label Legion of Death. Metal news website Metalluminati suggests that their claims of being based in Iraq are a hoax.[174] These bands, along with Tadnees (from Saudi Arabia), Halla (from Iran), False Allah (from Bahrain), and Mosque of Satan (from Lebanon), style themselves as the \"Arabic Anti-Islamic Legion.\" Another Lebanese band, Ayat, drew much attention with their debut album Six Years of Dormant Hatred, released through North American label Moribund Records in 2008.[173] Some European bands have also begun expressing anti-Islamic views, most notably the Norwegian band Taake.[175]\n\nRegarding the sound of black metal, there are two conflicting groups within the genre: \"those that stay true to the genre's roots, and those that introduce progressive elements\".[24] The former believe that the music should always be minimalist\u2014performed only with the standard guitar-bass-drums setup and recorded in a low fidelity style. One supporter of this train of thought is Blake Judd of Nachtmystium, who has rejected labeling his band black metal for its departure from the genre's typical sound.[176] Snorre Ruch of Thorns, on the other hand, has said that modern black metal is \"too narrow\" and believes that this was \"not the idea at the beginning\".[177]\n\nSince the 1990s, different styles of black metal have emerged and some have melded Norwegian-style black metal with other genres:\n\nAmbient black metal is a style of black metal that relies on heavy incorporation of atmospheric, sometimes dreamy textures, and is therefore less aggressive. It often features synthesizers or classical instrumentation, typically for melody or ethereal \"shimmering\" over the wall of sound provided by the guitars. The music is usually slow to mid paced with rare blast beat usage, without any abrupt changes and generally features slowly developing, sometimes repetitive melodies and riffs, which separate it from other black metal styles. Subject matter usually concerns nature, folklore, mythology, and personal introspection.[178] Artists include Summoning,[179] Agalloch[180] and Wolves in the Throne Room.[180]\n\nBlack-doom, also known as blackened doom, is a style that combines the slowness and thicker, bassier sound of doom metal with the shrieking vocals and heavily distorted guitar sound of black metal.[28][181] Black-doom bands maintain the Satanic ideology associated with black metal, while melding it with moodier themes more related to doom metal, like depression, nihilism and nature.[28] They also use the slower pace of doom metal in order to emphasize the harsh atmosphere present in black metal.[182] Examples of black-doom bands include Barathrum,[183] Forgotten Tomb,[181] Woods of Ypres,[184] Deinonychus,[185] Shining,[186] Nortt,[187] Bethlehem,[188] early Katatonia,[189] Tiamat,[182] Dolorian,[182] and October Tide.[182]\n\nPioneered by black-doom bands like Ophthalamia, Katatonia, Bethlehem, Forgotten Tomb and Shining, depressive suicidal black metal, also known as suicidal black metal, depressive black metal or DSBM, is a style that melds the second wave-style of black metal with doom metal,[190] with lyrics revolving around themes such as depression, self-harm, misanthropy, suicide and death.[29][30] DSBM bands draw on the lo-fi recording and highly distorted guitars of black metal, while employing the usage of acoustic instruments and non-distorted electric guitar timbres present in doom metal, interchanging the slower, doom-like, sections with faster tremolo picking.[190] Vocals are usually high-pitched like in black metal, but lacking energy, simulating feelings like hopelessness, desperation, and entreaty.[190] The presence of one-man bands is more prominent in this genre compared to others.[190] Examples of bands include Xasthur,[191] Leviathan,[190] Strid,[190] Silencer,[29][30] Make a Change\u2026 Kill Yourself,[190] Lifelover[192] and I Shalt Become.[29][30]\n\nBlack 'n' roll is a style of black metal that incorporates elements from 1970s hard rock and rock and roll music.[193] Examples of black 'n' roll bands include Midnight,[194] Kvelertak,[195] Vreid,[196] and Khold.[193][197] Bands such as Satyricon,[193][198][199] Nachtmystium,[200] Nidingr,[201] Craft,[193] and Sarke also experimented with the genre.[202]\n\nCrust punk groups, such as Antisect, Sacrilege and Anti System took some influence from early black metal bands like Venom, Hellhammer, and Celtic Frost,[203] while Amebix's lead vocalist and guitarist sent his band's early demo tape to Cronos of Venom, who replied by saying \"We'll rip you off.\"[204] Similarly, Bathory was initially inspired by crust punk as well as heavy metal.[205] Crust punk was affected by a second wave of black metal in the 1990s, with some bands emphasizing these black metal elements. Iskra are probably the most obvious example of second wave black metal-influenced crust punk;[206] Iskra coined their own phrase \"blackened crust\" to describe their new style. The Japanese group Gallhammer also fused crust punk with black metal[207] while the English band Fukpig has been said to have elements of crust punk, black metal, and grindcore.[208][209] North Carolina's Young and in the Way have been playing blackened crust since their formation in 2009.[210] In addition, Norwegian band Darkthrone have incorporated crust punk traits in their more recent material. As Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,\n\nIn a very ironic paradox, black metal and crust punk have recently started to embrace one another. Members of Darkthrone and Satyricon have lately claimed that they love punk, while among crusties, black metal is the latest fashion. In fact, the latest album by crust punk band Skitsystem sounds very black metal\u2014while the latest black metal opus by Darkthrone sounds very punk! This would have been unimaginable in the early 90s.[211]\nMany \"red and anarchist black metal\" (RABM) artists are influenced by crust punk or have a background in that scene.\n\nBlackened death-doom is a genre that combines the slow tempos and monolithic drumming of doom metal, the complex and loud riffage of death metal and the shrieking vocals of black metal.[212] Examples of blackened death-doom bands include Morast,[212] Faustcoven,[212] The Ruins of Beverast,[212] B\u00f6lzer,[212] Necros Christos,[212] Harvest Gulgaltha,[213] Dragged into Sunlight,[214] Hands of Thieves,[215] and Soulburn.[216][217]\n\nBlackened death metal is commonly death metal that incorporates musical, lyrical or ideological elements of black metal, such as an increased use of tremolo picking, anti-Christian or Satanic lyrical themes and chord progressions similar to those used in black metal.[218][219] Blackened death metal bands are also more likely to wear corpse paint and suits of armour, than bands from other styles of death metal.[220] Lower range guitar tunings, death growls and abrupt tempo changes are common in the genre.[221] Examples of blackened death metal bands are Belphegor,[222] Behemoth,[223] Akercocke,[224] and Sacramentum.[225]\n\nMelodic black-death[226] (also known as blackened melodic death metal or melodic blackened death metal)[227] is a genre of extreme metal that describes the style created when melodic death metal bands began being inspired by black metal and European romanticism. However, unlike most other black metal, this take on the genre incorporated an increased sense of melody and narrative.[227] Some bands who have played this style include Dissection,[227][226][228] Sacramentum,[227][226] Naglfar,[227] God Dethroned,[229] Dawn,[227] Unanimated,[227] Thulcandra,[226][227] Skeletonwitch[230] and Cardinal Sin.[226]\n\nWar metal[63][64][65] (also known as war black metal[64] or bestial black metal)[65] is an aggressive,[64] cacophonous,[63] and chaotic[63][64] subgenre of blackened death metal,[231] described by Rock Hard journalist Wolf-R\u00fcdiger M\u00fchlmann as \"rabid\"[64] and \"hammering\".[64] Important influences include early black and death metal bands, such as Sodom,[63][64] Possessed,[64] Autopsy,[64] Sarc\u00f3fago,[63][64][65][116] and the first two Sepultura releases,[64][116] as well as seminal grindcore acts like Repulsion.[63][64] War metal bands include Blasphemy,[63][64][116] Archgoat,[64] Impiety,[64] and Bestial Warlust.[232]\n\nBlackened grindcore is a fusion genre that combines elements of black metal and grindcore.[233][234]  Notable bands include Anaal Nathrakh and early Rotting Christ.[235]\n\nBlackened thrash metal, also known as black-thrash,[236] is a fusion genre that combines elements of black metal and thrash metal.[236][237] Being considered one of the first fusions of extreme metal,[236] it was inspired by bands such as Venom, Sodom, and Sarc\u00f3fago.[238] Notable bands include Aura Noir,[239] Witchery,[240][241] Black Fast,[242] Sathanas,[243] and Destr\u00f6yer 666.[237]\n\nFolk black metal, pagan metal and Viking metal are styles that incorporates elements of folk music, with pagan metal bands focusing on pagan lyrics and imagery,[244] and Viking metal bands giving thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age, more influenced by Nordic folk music.[245] While not focused on Satanism, the bands' use of ancient folklore and mythologies still express anti-Christian views, with folk black metal doing it as part of a \"rebellion to the status quo\", that developed concurrently along with the rise of folk metal in Europe in the 1990s,[246][244] Notable artist include Negur\u0103 Bunget,[246] Windir,[247] Primordial,[248][249] In the Woods...,[250] Cruachan,[251] and Bathory, to whose albums Blood Fire Death (1988) and Hammerheart (1990) the origin of Viking metal can be traced.[252]\n\nIndustrial black metal is a style of black metal that incorporates elements of industrial music. Mysticum, formed in 1991,[253] was the first of these groups.[254] DHG (D\u00f8dheimsgard), Thorns from Norway and Blut Aus Nord, N.K.V.D. and Blacklodge from France, have been acclaimed for their incorporation of industrial elements.[255] Other industrial black metal musicians include Samael,[256][257] The Axis of Perdition,[258] Aborym,[259] and ...And Oceans.[260] In addition, The Kovenant,[261] Mortiis and Ulver emerged from the Norwegian black metal scene, but later chose to experiment with industrial music.[262][263]\n\nPost-black metal is an umbrella term for genres that experiment beyond black metal's conventions and broaden their sounds, evolving past the genre's limits.[264] Notable bands include Myrkur,[265] Alcest,[266] Bosse-de-Nage,[267] and Wildernessking.[268]\n\nBlackgaze incorporates common black metal and post-black metal elements such as blast beat drumming and high-pitched screamed vocals with the melodic and heavily distorted guitar styles typically associated with shoegazing.[269][270] It is associated with bands such as Deafheaven,[271] Alcest,[272] Vaura,[270] Amesoeurs,[273] Bosse-de-Nage,[270] Oathbreaker,[274] and Fen.[270]\n\nPsychedelic black metal is a subgenre of black metal which employs the usage of psychedelic elements.[275] Notable acts include Oranssi Pazuzu,[275][276][277] Nachtmystium,[277] Deafheaven,[277] Woe,[277] Amesoeurs,[277] and In the Woods....[278]\n\nRaw black metal is a subgenre that seeks to amplify the primitive qualities of the second wave of black metal, by giving priority to its lo-fi production values.[279][280] To achieve this, bands under this style usually emphasize the usage of higher-pitches in their guitar sound and vocals, while employing techniques such as tremolo picking and blast beats more often.[280] Its imagery is often associated with dystopic and minimalistic tendencies.[279][280] The style was pioneered by Ildjarn,[281] with other notable bands including Gorgoroth[279] and Darkthrone.[282]\n\nSymphonic black metal is a style of black metal that incorporates symphonic and orchestral elements. This may include the usage of instruments found in symphony orchestras (piano, violin, cello, flute and keyboards), \"clean\" or operatic vocals and guitars with less distortion.[283]\nNotable bands include Emperor, Troll, Dimmu Borgir and Bal Sagoth.[284][285]\n\nUnlike other metal genres, black metal is associated with an ideology and ethos. It is fiercely opposed to Christianity[35] and the other main institutional religions, Islam and Judaism. Many black metal bands are Satanists and see Satanism as a key part of black metal. Others advocate ethnic Paganism, \"often coupled with nationalism\",[286] although the early Pagan bands did not call themselves 'black metal'.[250][287][288]\n\nBlack metal tends to be misanthropic and hostile to modern society.[24] It is \"a reaction against the mundanity, insincerity and emotional emptiness that participants feel is intrinsic to modern secular culture\".[289] The black metal scene tends to oppose political correctness, humanitarianism, consumerism, globalization and homogeneity.[290][291][292] Aaron Weaver from Wolves in the Throne Room said: \"I think that black metal is an artistic movement that is critiquing modernity on a fundamental level, saying that the modern world view is missing something\".[293] As part of this, some parts of the scene glorify nature and have a fascination with the distant past.[294][295] Black metal has been likened to Romanticism and there is an undercurrent of romantic nationalism in the genre.[296][297] Sam Dunn noted that \"unlike any other heavy metal scene, the culture and the place is incorporated into the music and imagery\".[35] Individualism is also an important part of black metal,[35] with Fenriz of Darkthrone describing black metal as \"individualism above all\".[298] Unlike other kinds of metal, black metal has numerous one-man bands. However, it is argued that followers of Euronymous were anti-individualistic,[299] and that \"Black Metal is characterized by a conflict between radical individualism and group identity and by an attempt to accept both polarities simultaneously\".[294]\n\nIn his master's thesis, Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that some artists can be seen as transcendentalists. Dissatisfied with a \"world that they feel is devoid of spiritual and cultural significance\",[300] they try to leave or \"transcend\" their \"mundane physical forms\" and become one with the divine.[301] This is done through their concerts, which he describes as \"musical rituals\" that involve self-mortification and taking on an alternative, \"spiritual persona\" (for example by the wearing of costume and face paint).[302]\n\nGenerally, black metal strives to remain an underground phenomenon.[79]\n\nBlack metal was originally a term for extreme metal bands with Satanic lyrics and imagery.[303]\nHowever, most of the 'first wave' bands (including Venom, who coined the term 'black metal') were not Satanists and rather used Satanic themes to provoke controversy or gain attention. One of the few exceptions was Mercyful Fate singer and Church of Satan member King Diamond, whom Michael Moynihan calls \"one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a poseur using a devilish image for shock value\".[304]\n\nIn the early 1990s, many Norwegian black-metallers presented themselves as genuine Devil worshippers.[305] Mayhem's Euronymous was the key figure behind this.[299] They attacked the Church of Satan for its \"freedom and life-loving\" views;[306] the theistic Satanism they espoused was an inversion of Christianity. Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that they \"transform[ed] Venom's quasi-Satanic stage theatrics into a form of cultural expression unique from other forms of metal or Satanism\" and \"abandoned the mundane identities and ambitions of other forms of metal in favor of religious and ideological fanaticism\".[299] Some prominent scene members\u2014such as Euronymous and Faust[11][50]\u2014stated that only bands who are Satanists can be called 'black metal'. Bands with a Norwegian style, but without Satanic lyrics, tended to use other names for their music.[250][287][288] This view is still held by many artists\u2014such as Infernus,[307] Arioch,[308] Nornagest and Erik Danielsson.[309] Some bands, like the reformed Dissection[142][144] and Watain,[310] insist that all members must be of the same Satanic belief, whereas Michael Ford of Black Funeral[119] and MkM of Antaeus[311] believe black metal must be Satanic but not all band members need to be Satanists. Others\u2014such as Jan Axel Blomberg,[312] Sigurd Wongraven[24] and Eric Horner[313]\u2014believe that black metal does not need to be Satanic. An article in Metalion's Slayer fanzine attacked musicians that \"care more about their guitars than the actual essence onto which the whole concept was and is based upon\", and insisted that \"the music itself doesn't come as the first priority\".[314] Bands with a similar style but with Pagan lyrics tend to be referred to as 'Pagan Metal' by many 'purist' black-metallers.[315]\n\nOthers shun Satanism, seeing it as Christian or \"Judeo-Christian\" in origin,[316][317] and regard Satanists as perpetuating the \"Judeo-Christian\" worldview.[318] Quorthon of Bathory said he used 'Satan' to provoke and attack Christianity. However, with his third and fourth albums, Under the Sign of the Black Mark and Blood Fire Death, he began \"attacking Christianity from a different angle\", realizing that Satanism is a \"Christian product\".[317] Nevertheless, some artists use Satan as a symbol or metaphor for their beliefs, such as LaVeyan Satanists (who are atheist). Vocalist Gaahl, who considers himself a Norse Shaman,[319] said: \"We use the word 'Satanist' because it is Christian world and we have to speak their language ... When I use the word 'Satan', it means the natural order, the will of a man, the will to grow, the will to become the superman\".[320] Varg Vikernes called himself a Satanist in early interviews but \"now downplays his former interest in Satanism\", saying he was using Satan as a symbol for Odin as the 'adversary' of the Christian God.[321] He saw Satanism as \"an introduction to more indigenous heathen beliefs\".[322] Some bands such as Carach Angren[323] and Enslaved[324][325] do not have Satanic lyrics.\n\n'Unblack metal' (or 'Christian black metal') promotes Christianity through its lyrics and imagery.[326] The first unblack metal record, Hellig Usvart (1994) by Australian artist Horde, was a provocative parody of Norwegian black metal. It sparked controversy, and death threats were issued against Horde. Norwegian Christian metal band Crush Evil adopted a black metal style in the late 1990s and were renamed Antestor.\n\nMany black-metallers see \"Christian black metal\" as an oxymoron[327] and believe black metal cannot be Christian.[24] In fact, the early unblack metal groups Horde and Antestor refused to call their music \"black metal\" because they did not share its ethos. Horde called its music \"holy unblack metal\"[328] and Antestor called theirs \"sorrow metal\".[329] Horde's Jayson Sherlock later said \"I will never understand why Christians think they can play Black Metal. I really don't think they understand what true Black Metal is\".[330] However, current unblack metal bands such as Crimson Moonlight feel that black metal has changed from an ideological movement to a purely musical genre, and thus call their music 'black metal'.[327]\n\nBlack metal has a long tradition of environmentalism.[331][163] Groups such as Botanist and Wolves in the Throne Room have been described as exemplifying radical environmentalism.[332][333][334]\n\nA wide range of political views are found in the black metal scene. Black metal is generally not political music and the vast majority of bands do not express their political views.[335][336][337]  The genre is seen more as \"fantastical escapism\". Artists usually see themselves as merely depicting the \"macabre nature of the world\" as opposed to what they see as the \"preachiness\" of genres like hardcore punk.[338] Ihsahn of Emperor explained: \"I see it much more as an atmospheric and emotional thing rather than a political one. Hardcore bands can deal with political things; black metal is something else\".[339]\n\nHowever, some black metal artists promote political ideologies. National Socialist black metal (NSBM) promotes neo-Nazi or far-right politics through its lyrics and imagery. It is \"distinguished only by ideology, not musical character\".[340] Artists typically meld neo-Nazism with ethnic European paganism, but a few meld these beliefs with Satanism or occultism. Some commentators see it as a natural development of the \"black metal worldview\". Members of the early Norwegian scene flirted with Nazi themes, but this was largely for shock value and to provoke.[341] Varg Vikernes\u2014who now refers to his ideology as 'Odalism'[342]\u2014is credited with popularizing such views within the scene.[343][344] Some bands blend Nazism and Satanism by voicing support for fascist satanist groups like the Order of Nine Angles, bands that have featured ONA ideology and symbolism in their albums include Hvile I Kaos, Altar of Perversion, Aosoth and Spear of Longinus.[345][346][347][348]\n\nNSBM artists are a small minority within the genre.[337][349] While some black metal fans boycott Neo-Nazi artists, others are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.[151] NSBM has been criticized by some prominent and influential black metal artists\u2014including Jon N\u00f6dtveidt,[136] Gorgoroth,[350][351][352] Dark Funeral,[5][353] Richard Lederer,[354] Michael Ford,[355] and Arkhon Infaustus.[5] Some liken Nazism to Christianity by arguing that both are authoritarian, collectivist, and a \"herd mentality\".[136][350] Olson writes that the shunning of Nazism by some black-metallers \"has nothing to do with notions of a 'universal humanity' or a rejection of hate\" but that Nazism is shunned \"because its hatred is too specific and exclusive\".[356]\n\nPartly in reaction to NSBM, a small number of artists began promoting left-wing politics such as anarchism or Marxism,[357][358][359][360] creating a movement known as \"Red and anarchist black metal\" (RABM).[361][362][363] Many artists have a background in anarchist crust punk.[360] Artists labelled RABM include Iskra, Panopticon, Skagos,[360][363] Storm of Sedition,[362] Not A Cost,[362] and Black Kronstadt.[362] Some others with similar outlook, such as Wolves in the Throne Room, are not overtly political and do not endorse the label.[360]\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_metal", "content": "\n\nPower metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional heavy metal with speed metal, often within a symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in, for example, extreme metal. Power metal bands usually have anthemic songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \"powerful\" sound.[1][2]\n\nThe term was first used in the mid-1980s[3] and refers to two different but related styles:\n\nAnthropologist Sam Dunn traced the origins of power metal back to the late 1970s, when the groundwork for power metal lyrical style was laid down by Ronnie James Dio. The fantasy-oriented lyrics he wrote for Rainbow, concentrated around medieval, renaissance, folk, and science fiction themes, directly influenced modern power metal bands.[5] According to Dunn, the songs \"Stargazer\" and \"A Light in the Black\" from the 1976 album Rising, as well as \"Kill the King\" and \"Lady of the Lake\" from the 1978 album Long Live Rock 'n' Roll, might be among the earliest examples of power metal. In his 2011 documentary series Metal Evolution,[6] Dunn further explained how Rob Halford of Judas Priest created a blueprint for power metal vocal delivery. His almost constant high-pitched singing became one of the main characteristics of power metal. The twin-guitar sound promoted by Judas Priest's duo of K. K. Downing and Glenn Tipton also highly influenced this subgenre.\n\nAnother British band, Iron Maiden, brought epic and melodic sensibility to metal, creating anthemic, singalong music, an approach widely embraced by modern power metal musicians. Referred to as the \"main prototype\" of the power metal genre, Iron Maiden was heavily influenced by Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules (the first two albums of Black Sabbath's Dio-era), which would also go on to influence modern power metal.[7]\n\nThe emergence of the early German power metal scene in particular was made possible by Scorpions and Accept. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen made a significant impact on many future power metal guitarists, with his accurate and fast neo-classical style. His bandmate Jens Johansson modernized the keyboard sound of Deep Purple's Jon Lord, which was further incorporated into the genre. Manowar's mythological sword and sorcery lyrics influenced a number of power metal bands.\n\nThroughout the early 1980s (especially during 1982 and 1983), the US power metal style first emerged from traditional heavy metal, the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM), and thrash/speed metal backgrounds. Although the genre's precise stylistic origins are often contested, acts such as Cirith Ungol, Jag Panzer, Manilla Road, Omen, Riot, Savatage, and Warlord are generally believed to have influenced the earliest development of the style.[8][9]\n\nMore concretely, in 1987 German band Helloween released their second album, Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I, cited by AllMusic as \"a landmark recording that remains arguably the single most influential power metal album to date. Its volatile combination of power and melody would inspire an entire generation of metal bands\".[10] This release influenced a European power metal style to evolve, which proliferated throughout the globe and since the start of the 1990s is still the most commonly heard style of power metal.[citation needed]\n\nPower metal \"bears all the hallmarks of traditional metal\" is today associated with fast guitar riffs and drumming, twin melodies, operatic singing. The sound is tempered by characteristics of speed metal, power metal's musical forerunner.[11]\n\nPower metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with \"clean\" vocals being much more prevalent than the growling vocals often associated with extreme metal. Inspired by Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, Geoff Tate, and other heavy metal vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high register, and the singer's vocal range is usually wide.[12] The majority of the genre's vocalists sing in the tenor range and are capable of hitting very high notes, for example Timo Kotipelto of Stratovarius, Tony Kakko of Sonata Arctica, Michael Kiske (Helloween) and Andre Matos (ex-Angra). There are many exceptions who sing in either baritone or bass range. Some vocalists sing in a harsh, thrash metal style, including Chris Boltendahl of Grave Digger, Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Peavy Wagner of Rage, and Wintersun's Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4.[13] Many power metal vocalists, most notably Hansi K\u00fcrsch of Blind Guardian, record multi-layered vocals reminiscent of Queen, creating a choral effect.[14]\n\nThemes that frequently feature throughout other metal subgenres, such as religion and politics, are comparatively rare in power metal - albeit not unheard of. Power metal's lyrical themes often focus on fantasy and mythology,[11] camaraderie and hope, personal struggles and emotions, war and death, or combinations of the aforementioned. For example, Finnish band Sonata Arctica have been known for focusing their lyrics of their songs on fantasy but also have many songs based on reality, love and relationships.\n\nMany power metal bands based their concept albums on fantasy books and national epics; Blind Guardian based Nightfall in Middle-Earth on Tolkien's The Silmarillion, while Kamelot based Epica and The Black Halo on Goethe's Faust. Some bands have even written their own imaginary stories, like Rhapsody of Fire's Emerald Sword Saga and The Dark Secret Saga, Iced Earth's Something Wicked Saga, or Avantasia by Edguy's Tobias Sammet.\n\nHistorical themes have also seen usage in the works of bands, most famously Sabaton, whose lyrics extensively focus on historical wars, battles, and individuals that received notable recognition for their wartime accomplishments. Examples include World War I, World War II, Vikings, Samurai, and much more from around the world including the American, Swedish and German militaries. Serenity, an Austrian (symphonic) power metal band, focuses mainly on historical figures and events, including Sir Francis Drake, Marco Polo, Galileo, Beethoven, and Napoleon.\n\nContrary to traditional power metal music, Powerwolf focuses on Transylvanian werewolf and vampire legends and dark myths. The lyrics of the band are characterized by the treatment of Christianity and ancient Romanian legends. Powerwolf, however, do not consider themselves a religious band, but rather call themselves spiritual.\n\nPower metal guitarists and bassists generally play rapid streams of notes,[11] but change chords comparatively slowly, with a harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower. Fast and technically demanding guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed.[15] The slow changing of chords is significant in defining power metal just as the fast rapid chord changes often define traditional thrash metal. Power metal often makes use of Major chord progressions as well as circle progressions. Some of the most influential and acclaimed power metal guitarists are Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Michael Weikath of Helloween, and Timo Tolkki formerly of Stratovarius. It is a common trait in power metal for the bass guitar to take a back seat, so to speak; often simply providing the chord root notes and being drowned out by the more prevalent rhythm guitars. However, some power metal bands incorporate bass that is more audible with colorful patterns distinct from the rhythm guitars, such as Helloween, Hibria, and Symphony X.\n\nMany power metal drummers play double bass patterns with either two bass drums, or utilize a double bass pedal; using them to play a constant stream of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) with snare drum accents on the beat, a style not restricted to, but most often associated with, power metal. The style was used by drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg of Helloween, setting a blueprint for many other drummers to follow. Others, such as the drummers of Blind Guardian and Iced Earth, use a more thrash metal style of drumming with rapid bursts of double bass that involve three to six beats with the double kick.\n\nPower metal bands often incorporate keyboards into their musical arrangements,[16] something popularized by Jens Johansson of Stratovarius (though their prominence varies). Some power metal bands also record with symphonic elements, and as such, they utilize a full orchestra to fill the role usually played by the keyboardist.[17]\n\nThe American branch of power metal emerged in early 1980s in the United States, drawing influence primarily from traditional metal and the NWOBHM. Though very close to its roots, US power metal (often abbreviated USPM) is often faster and more energetic than traditional heavy metal, with a more riff-driven approach and a relative lack of keyboard usage compared to its later European counterpart. However, it is often more melodic than thrash metal, with a greater emphasis on guitar leads. USPM is also notable for its widespread (but not universal) use of high-register operatic vocals, a trend which would continue with the rise of European power metal in the late 1980s and early 1990s.[15] This style is not exclusive to North America, as European bands such as Sacred Steel, Majesty, and Australian band Pegazus later adopted a style inspired by USPM bands in the 1990s.\n\nThe early releases of progressive metal bands Queensr\u00ffche and Fates Warning, such as The Warning (1984) and The Spectre Within (1985), heavily influenced a number of bands that were to develop a common sound towards the late 1980s. Among the better known representatives of the style, such as Manowar, Vicious Rumors, Virgin Steele, Riot, or Jag Panzer, a small number of bands enriched their sound with progressive and epic elements (the most obvious examples being Crimson Glory, Savatage, Sanctuary and the epic doom metal band Cirith Ungol); or even with thrash metal elements, e.g., Iced Earth.[18] US power metal saw a sharp decline in popularity at the beginning of the 1990s, though the style has rebounded somewhat in the past decade, with bands such as Liege Lord or Heir Apparent reforming for live performances[19] and many, such as Helstar and Omen, still releasing new material.\n\nEuropean power metal originated from speed metal and the NWOBHM, emerging in late 1980s, particularly in Germany, with Helloween, Running Wild, Rage, Grave Digger, and Blind Guardian. The second and third Helloween albums; Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I (1987) and Part II (1988) are usually considered the first proper European power metal albums.[20] Alongside the early German bands came Finland's Stratovarius in late 1980s. These bands pioneered the genre, but took it in somewhat different directions. Helloween, followed by early Gamma Ray, mixed fast palm muted speed metal riffs with high-pitched clean vocals, and with a strong focus on melody and uplifting, positive themes. Stratovarius further developed this melodic direction by making heavy use of keyboards, with lyrics dealing with emotions and personal issues. Blind Guardian utilized the technique of vocal and guitar overdubbing to create an epic atmosphere, with lyrical content strongly based on fantasy novels, myths and legends. The symphonic and neo-classical elements also found their way through power metal with bands like Rhapsody of Fire (Italy), Serenity (Austria) and Nightwish (Finland).[21] At the same time, bands such as HammerFall simplified their power metal to bring it closer to traditional heavy metal.\n\nOver the late 90s and early 00s, power metal spread over Europe especially as well as the rest of the world, often incorporating new influences. Italy's Elvenking, Sweden's Falconer, Spain's M\u00e4go de Oz, and Denmark's Wuthering Heights integrated elements of folk music with power metal. Angra, Kamelot, and especially Symphony X are known for combining progressive and power metal. Some bands are known for combining power metal with more aggressive musical forms; Children of Bodom were one of the earliest who combined elements of power metal and an early form of melodic death metal.\n\nEuropean-style power metal became widespread in comparison with US style as of the mid 1990s, with numerous North American bands such as Theocracy, Borealis, Forgotten Tales, Avian, Pharaoh, Circle II Circle, and Kamelot demonstrating the style. This European style of power metal is sometimes considered the \"second wave\" of power metal since its spread was in the late 1980s and especially the mid-late 1990s rather than proliferating throughout the 1980s, and the widespread influence and development of the genre that came in its tow while US \"first wave\" style markedly declined.\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica", "content": "\n\nMetallica is an American heavy metal band. It was formed in Los Angeles in 1981 by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career.[1][2] The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.\n\nMetallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, Master of Puppets (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its fifth album, Metallica (1991), was a turning point for the band that saw them transition from their thrash roots; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling more than 16\u00a0million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's eleventh and most recent album, 72 Seasons, was released in 2023.\n\nIn 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Anger (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film Metallica: Through the Never, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.\n\nMetallica has released eleven studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the San Francisco Symphony), twelve video albums, one cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won ten Grammy Awards from 26 nominations and had six consecutive studio albums \u2013 from Metallica through Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2016) \u2013 debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold more than 125\u00a0million albums worldwide as of 2018[update].[3] Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as Rolling Stone, which ranked the band in 61st place on its list of 100 greatest artists of all time.[4] As of 2017[update], Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991,[5] selling 58\u00a0million albums in the United States.[6]\n\nMetallica was formed in Los Angeles in late 1981 when Danish drummer Lars Ulrich placed an advertisement in a Los Angeles newspaper, The Recycler, which read, \"Drummer looking for other metal musicians to jam with Tygers of Pan Tang, Diamond Head and Iron Maiden.\"[9] Guitarists James Hetfield and Hugh Tanner of Leather Charm answered the advertisement. Although he had not formed a band, Ulrich asked Metal Blade Records founder Brian Slagel if he could record a song for the label's upcoming compilation album, Metal Massacre. Slagel accepted, and Ulrich recruited Hetfield to sing and play rhythm guitar.[9] The band was officially formed on October 28, 1981, five months after Ulrich and Hetfield first met.[10][11]\n\nThe band name came from Ulrich's friend Ron Quintana, who was brainstorming names for a fanzine and was considering MetalMania or Metallica. After hearing the two names, Ulrich wanted the latter for his band, so he suggested Quintana use MetalMania instead.[12] Dave Mustaine replied to an advertisement for a lead guitarist; Ulrich and Hetfield recruited him after seeing his expensive guitar equipment. In early 1982, Metallica recorded its first original song, \"Hit the Lights\", for the Metal Massacre I compilation. Hetfield sang and played both bass and rhythm guitar, while Lars Ulrich played drums and Lloyd Grant was credited with a guitar solo.[9] Metal Massacre I was released on June 14, 1982; early pressings listed the band incorrectly as \"Mettallica\", angering the band.[13] The song generated word of mouth, and the band played its first live performance on March 14, 1982, at Radio City in Anaheim, California, with newly recruited bassist Ron McGovney.[14] Their first live success came early; they were chosen to open for British heavy metal band Saxon at one gig of their 1982 U.S. tour. This was Metallica's second gig. Metallica recorded its first demo, Power Metal, whose name was inspired by Quintana's early business cards, in early 1982.\n\nThe term \"thrash metal\" was coined in February 1984 by Kerrang! journalist Malcolm Dome in reference to Anthrax's song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\".[15] Prior to this, Hetfield referred to Metallica's sound as \"power metal\". In late 1982, Ulrich and Hetfield attended a show at the West Hollywood nightclub Whisky a Go Go, which featured bassist Cliff Burton in the band Trauma. The two were \"blown away\" by Burton's use of a wah-wah pedal and asked him to join Metallica. Hetfield and Mustaine wanted McGovney to leave because they thought he \"didn't contribute anything, he just followed.\"[16] Although Burton initially declined the offer, by the end of the year, he had accepted on the condition that the band move to El Cerrito in the San Francisco Bay Area.[16] Metallica's first live performance with Burton was at the nightclub The Stone in March 1983, and the first recording to feature Burton was the Megaforce demo (1983).[16]\n\nMetallica was ready to record their debut album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the cost, they began looking for other options. Concert promoter Jonathan \"Jonny Z\" Zazula, who had heard the demo No Life 'til Leather (1982), offered to broker a record deal between Metallica and New York City\u2013based record labels. After those record labels showed no interest, Zazula borrowed enough money to cover the recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce Records.[17]\n\nIn May 1983, Metallica traveled to Rochester, New York, to record its debut album, Metal Up Your Ass, which was produced by Paul Curcio.[18] The other members decided to eject Mustaine from the band because of his drug and alcohol abuse and violent behavior just before the recording sessions on April 11, 1983.[19] Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett replaced Mustaine the same afternoon.[17] Metallica's first live performance with Hammett was on April 16, 1983, at a nightclub in Dover, New Jersey, called The Showplace;[16] the support act was Anthrax's original lineup, which included Dan Lilker and Neil Turbin.[20] This was the first time the two bands performed live together.[16]\n\nMustaine, who went on to form Megadeth, has expressed his dislike for Hammett in interviews, saying Hammett \"stole\" his job.[21] Mustaine was \"pissed off\" because he believes Hammett became popular by playing guitar leads that Mustaine had actually written.[22] In a 1985 interview with Metal Forces, Mustaine said, \"It's real funny how Kirk Hammett ripped off every lead break I'd played on that No Life 'til Leather tape and got voted No.\u00a01 guitarist in your magazine.\"[23] On Megadeth's debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! (1985), Mustaine included the song \"Mechanix\", which Metallica had previously reworked and retitled \"The Four Horsemen\" on Kill 'Em All. Mustaine said he did this to \"straighten Metallica up\" because Metallica referred to Mustaine as a drunk and said he could not play guitar.[23]\n\nBecause of conflicts with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your Ass, the album was renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard\u00a0200 in 1986.[24][a] Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene.[25] To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven.[26] In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.[27]\n\nMetallica recorded its second studio album, Ride the Lightning, at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from February to March 1984. It was released in August 1984 and reached number 100 on the Billboard\u00a0200.[28] A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors' items. Mustaine received writing co-credit for \"Ride the Lightning\" and \"The Call of Ktulu\".[27]\n\nElektra Records A&R director Michael Alago and co-founder of Q-Prime Management Cliff Burnstein attended a Metallica concert in September 1984; they were impressed with the performance, signed Metallica to Elektra and made the band a client of Q-Prime Management.[29] Metallica's growing success was such that the band's British label, Music for Nations, released \"Creeping Death\" as a limited-edition single, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the record \u2013 cover versions of Diamond Head's \"Am I Evil?\" and Blitzkrieg's \"Blitzkrieg\" \u2013 appeared on the 1988 Elektra reissue of Kill 'Em All.[30] Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S., it embarked on a co-headlining tour with W.A.S.P. and support from Armored Saint. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park, England, on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt, playing to 70,000 people. At a show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival, the band played to a crowd of 60,000.[29]\n\nMetallica's third studio album, Master of Puppets, was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios from September to December 1985 and released in March 1986. The album reached number 29 on the Billboard\u00a0200 and spent 72 weeks on the chart.[31] It was the band's first album to be certified Gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times Platinum in 2003.[32] Steve Huey of AllMusic considered the album \"the band's greatest achievement\".[33] Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne on a U.S. tour.[29] Hetfield broke his wrist while skateboarding; he continued with the tour, performing vocals, with guitar technician John Marshall playing rhythm guitar.[34]\n\nOn September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica's Damage, Inc. Tour, members drew cards to determine which bunks on the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett's bunk. At around sunrise near D\u00f6rarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to overturn several times. Ulrich, Hammett and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, Burton was pinned under the bus and died. Hetfield said:\n\nI saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, \"Don't fucking do that!\" I already wanted to kill the [bus driver]. I don't know if he was drunk or if he hit some ice. All I knew was, he was driving and Cliff wasn't alive anymore.[34]\nBurton's death left Metallica's future in doubt. The three remaining members decided Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family's blessings, the band sought a replacement.[35] Roughly 40 people \u2013 including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus; Troy Gregory of Prong; and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam \u2013 auditioned for the band to fill Burton's spot. Newsted learned Metallica's entire setlist; after the audition, Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; his first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.[35] The band finished its tour in February 1987.\n\nAfter Newsted joined Metallica, the band left their El Cerrito practice space \u2013 a suburban house formerly rented by sound engineer Mark Whitaker and dubbed \"the Metalli-mansion\" \u2013 and relocated to the adjacent cities of Berkeley and Albany before eventually settling in the Marin County city of San Rafael, north of San Francisco.[36][37] In March 1987, Hetfield again broke his wrist while skateboarding, forcing the band to cancel an appearance on Saturday Night Live. In August 1987, an all-covers extended play (EP), titled The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited, was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to use the band's newly constructed recording studio, test Newsted's talents, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff 'Em All commemorating Burton's three years in Metallica was released in 1987; the video included bass solos, home videos and pictures.[38]\n\nMetallica's first studio album since Burton's death, ...And Justice for All, was recorded from January to May 1988 and released in September. The album was a commercial success, reaching number 6 on the Billboard\u00a0200, and was the band's first album to enter the top 10.[28] The album was certified Platinum nine weeks after its release.[39] There were complaints about the production, however; Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ulrich's drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars \"buzz thinly\".[40] To promote the album, Metallica embarked on a tour called Damaged Justice.[41]\n\nIn 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for ...And Justice for All in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win, but the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave.[42] The award was controversial with fans and the press; Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song \"One\". Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony because he was expecting Metallica to win.[42] The award was named in Entertainment Weekly's \"Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets\" list.[43]\n\nFollowing the release of ...And Justice for All, Metallica released its debut music video for the song \"One\", which the band performed in an abandoned warehouse. The footage was remixed with the film Johnny Got His Gun. Rather than organize an ongoing licensing deal, Metallica purchased the rights to the film. The remixed video was submitted to MTV with an alternative, performance-only version that was held back in case MTV banned the remixed version. MTV accepted the remixed version; the video was viewers' first exposure to Metallica. In 1999, it was voted number 38 in MTV's \"Top 100 Videos of All Time\" countdown[44] and was featured on the network's 25th-anniversary edition of ADD Video, which showcased the most popular videos on MTV in the last 25 years.[45]\n\nIn October 1990, Metallica entered One on One Recording's studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with Aerosmith, The Cult, Bon Jovi and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, was hired as the producer. Metallica \u2013 also known as The Black Album \u2013 was remixed three times, cost US$1\u00a0million,[46] and ended Hammett and Ulrich's marriages.[47] Although the release was delayed until 1991, Metallica debuted at number one in 10 countries, selling 650,000 units in the U.S. during its first week.[48] The album brought Metallica mainstream attention; it has been certified 16 times Platinum in the U.S., which makes it the 25th-best-selling album in the country.[49] The making of Metallica and the following tour was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. The tour in support of the album, called the Wherever We May Roam Tour, lasted 14 months and included dates in the U.S., Japan and the U.K.[46] In September 1991, 1.6\u00a0million rock music fans converged in Moscow to enjoy the first open-air rock concert to be held in the Soviet Union; it was part of the Monsters of Rock series.[50] However, in a June 2020 interview, Lars estimated the attendance at about a half\u00a0million during their time slot.[51] In April 1992, Metallica appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and performed a three-song set.[52] Hetfield later performed \"Stone Cold Crazy\" with the remaining members of Queen and Tony Iommi.[52]\n\nOn August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour at the Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Hetfield suffered second- and third-degree burns to his arms, face, hands and legs. There had been some confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted in Hetfield walking into a 12-foot (3.7\u00a0m) flame during \"Fade to Black\".[53] Newsted said Hetfield's skin was \"bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger\".[54] Metallica returned to the stage 17 days later with guitar technician and Metal Church member John Marshall replacing Hetfield on guitar for the remainder of the tour, although Hetfield was able to sing. Later in 1993, Metallica went on the Nowhere Else to Roam Tour, playing five shows in Mexico City. Live Shit: Binge & Purge, the band's first box set, was released in November 1993. The collection contains three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.[54]\n\nAfter almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, which comprised three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy? and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard\u00a0200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album.[28] The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass.[55] The release marked another change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the band members' hair was cut. While Load was a commercial success, the band's change in style had polarized their fanbase.[56] Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996.[57][58]\n\nDuring early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album, titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine.[55] Reload, too, debuted at number one on the Billboard\u00a0200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart.[28] Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \"polished and reworked\" until judged releasable.[59] To promote Reload, Metallica performed \"Fuel\" and \"The Memory Remains\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.[60]\n\nIn 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, titled Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath and others, and the second disc featured the original version of The $5.98 E.P. \u2013 Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had become a scarce collectors' item. The album entered the Billboard\u00a0200 at number two.[60][61]\n\nOn April 21 and 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony, which was conducted by Michael Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on \"Nothing Else Matters\". Kamen approached Metallica in 1991 with the idea of pairing the band's music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event: \"No Leaf Clover\" and \"-Human\". The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film S&M. It entered the Billboard\u00a0200 at number two and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.[28]\n\nIn 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song \"I Disappear\", which was supposed to be released in combination with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network and also found that the band's entire catalogue was freely available.[62] Metallica filed a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[63]\n\nUlrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000.[62] Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down.[64] A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94\u00a0million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared.[65] On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets, according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.[66]\n\nAt the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, Ulrich appeared with host Marlon Wayans in a skit that criticized the idea of using Napster to share music. Wayans played a college student listening to Metallica's \"I Disappear\". Ulrich walked in and asked for an explanation, and he responded to Wayans' excuse that using Napster was just \"sharing\" by saying that Wayans' idea of sharing was \"borrowing things that were not yours without asking.\" He called in the Metallica road crew, who proceeded to confiscate all of Wayans' belongings, leaving him almost naked in an empty room. Napster creator Shawn Fanning responded later in the ceremony by presenting an award wearing a Metallica shirt that read: \"I borrowed this shirt from a friend. Maybe, if I like it, I'll buy one of my own.\" Ulrich was later booed on stage at the award show when he introduced the final musical act, Blink-182.[67][68]\n\nNewsted left Metallica on January 17, 2001, just as plans were being made to enter the recording studio. He said he left the band for \"private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love.\"[69] During a Playboy interview with Metallica, Newsted said he wanted to release an album with his side project, Echobrain. Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, \"When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica\" and that a side project is \"like cheating on your wife in a way.\"[57] Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied: \"My name isn't on those records. And I'm not out trying to sell them\" and raised questions such as, \"Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?\"[57]\n\nIn April 2001, filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky began following Metallica to document the recording process of the band's next studio album. Over two years they recorded more than 1,000 hours of footage. On July 19, 2001, before preparations to enter the recording studio, Hetfield entered rehab to treat his \"alcoholism and other addictions\". All recording plans were put on hold and the band's future was in doubt.[70] Hetfield left rehab on December 4, 2001,[70] and the band returned to the recording studio on April 12, 2002. Hetfield was required to limit his work to four hours a day between noon and 4\u00a0pm, and to spend the rest of his time with his family.[59] The footage recorded by Berlinger and Sinofsky was compiled into the documentary Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. In the documentary, Newsted said his former bandmates' decision to hire a therapist to help solve their problems which he felt they could have solved on their own was \"really fucking lame and weak\".[59]\n\nIn June 2003, Metallica's eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard\u00a0200, and drew mixed reactions from critics. Ulrich's \"steely\" sounding snare drum and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism.[71] Kevin Forest Moreau of Shakingthrough.net said, \"the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don't propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing\".[72] Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork described it as \"an utter mess\".[73] However, Blender magazine called it the \"grimiest and grimmest of the band's Bob Rock productions\", and New York Magazine called it \"utterly raw and rocking\".[74] The title track, \"St. Anger\", won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004; it was used as the official theme song for WWE's SummerSlam 2003.[75]\n\nFor the duration of St. Anger's recording period, producer Bob Rock played bass on the album and in several live shows at which Metallica performed during that time.[59] Once the record was completed, the band started to hold auditions for Newsted's permanent replacement. Bassists Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse\u2014among others\u2014auditioned for the role. After three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne's band, was chosen as the new bassist.[59] Newsted, who had joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod by that time, was Trujillo's replacement in Osbourne's band during the 2003 Ozzfest tour, which included Voivod.[76]\n\nBefore the band's set at the 2004 Download Festival, Ulrich was rushed to the hospital after having an anxiety seizure and was unable to perform.[77] Hetfield searched for last-minute volunteers to replace Ulrich. Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered. Lombardo performed \"Battery\" and \"The Four Horsemen\", Ulrich's drum technician Flemming Larsen performed \"Fade to Black\", and Jordison performed the remainder of the set.[78] Having toured for two years in support of St. Anger on the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 and the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, with multi-platinum rock band Godsmack in support, Metallica took a break from performing and spent most of 2005 with friends and family. The band opened for The Rolling Stones at SBC Park in San Francisco on November 13 and 15, 2005.[79]\n\nIn February 2006, Metallica announced on its official website that after 15 years, long-time producer Bob Rock would not be producing the band's next studio album. Instead, the band chose to work with producer Rick Rubin.[80] Around the same time, a petition signed by 1,500 fans was posted online in an attempt to encourage the band to prohibit Rock from producing Metallica albums, saying he had too much influence on the band's sound and musical direction. Rock said the petition hurt his children's feelings; he said, \"sometimes, even with a great coach, a team keeps losing. You have to get new blood in there.\"[81]\n\nIn December 2006, Metallica released a DVD titled The Videos 1989\u20132004, which sold 28,000 copies in its first week and entered the Billboard Top Videos chart at number three.[82] Metallica recorded a guitar-based interpretation of Ennio Morricone's \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" for a tribute album titled We All Love Ennio Morricone, which was released in February 2007. The track received a Grammy nomination at the 50th Grammy Awards for the category \"Best Rock Instrumental Performance\".[83] A recording of \"The Ecstasy of Gold\" has been played to introduce Metallica's performances since the 1980s.[84]\n\nMetallica scheduled the release of the album Death Magnetic as September 12, 2008, and the band filmed a music video for the album's first single, \"The Day That Never Comes\". On September 2, 2008, a record store in France began selling copies of Death Magnetic nearly two weeks before its scheduled worldwide release date,[85] which resulted in the album being made available on peer-to-peer clients. This prompted the band's UK distributor Vertigo Records to officially release the album on September 10, 2008. Rumors of Metallica or Warner Bros. taking legal action against the French retailer were unconfirmed, though drummer Lars Ulrich responded to the leak by saying, \"...We're ten days from release. I mean, from here, we're golden. If this thing leaks all over the world today or tomorrow, happy days. Happy days. Trust me\",[86] and, \"By 2008 standards, that's a victory. If you'd told me six months ago that our record wouldn't leak until 10 days out, I would have signed up for that.\"[87]\n\nDeath Magnetic marked a return to the band's traditional thrash metal sound. The album debuted at number one in the U.S., selling 490,000 units; Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the Billboard\u00a0200.[88] A week after its release, Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard\u00a0200 and the European album chart; it also became the fastest selling album of 2008 in Australia.[89] Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard\u00a0200 album chart for three consecutive weeks.

Ulrich said, \"There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs.\"[107]\n\nOn November 9, 2010, Metallica announced it would be headlining the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro on September 25, 2011.[108][109] On December 13, 2010, the band announced it would again play as part of the \"big four\" during the Sonisphere Festival at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, on July 8, 2011.

There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now.\" He added, \"The first album with Rick was also the first album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last record\u2014it's my hero\u2014it's a great team. And it's only gonna better; I really believe that. So I'm super-excited.\"[117] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album.[118]\n\nOn June 15, 2011, Metallica announced that recording sessions with singer-songwriter Lou Reed had concluded.

Records and launched an independent record label, Blackened Recordings, which will produce the band's future releases.[136][137] The band acquired the rights to all of its studio albums, which were all reissued through the new label.

He also said, \"I love Rick [Rubin]. We all love Rick. We're in touch with Rick constantly. We'll see where it goes. It would stun me if the record came out in 2013.\"[142] Also in 2013, the band starred in a 3D concert film titled Metallica: Through the Never, which was directed by Antal Nimr\u00f3d and was released in IMAX theaters on September 27.[143]\n\nIn an interview dated July 22, 2013, Ulrich told Ultimate Guitar, \"2014 will be all about making a new Metallica record\"; he said the album will most likely be released during 2015.[144] Kirk Hammett and Robert Trujillo later confirmed the band's intention to enter the studio.[145] At the second Orion Music + More festival held in Detroit, the band played under the name \"Dehaan\"\u2014a reference to actor Dane DeHaan, who starred in Metallica: Through the Never.[146] The band performed its debut album Kill 'Em All in its entirety, celebrating the 30th anniversary of its release.[147]\n\nOn December 8, 2013, the band played a show called \"Freeze 'Em All\" in Antarctica, becoming the first band to play on all seven continents.[148] The performance was filmed and released as a live album the same month.[149]\n\nAt the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in January 2014, Metallica performed \"One\" with Chinese pianist Lang Lang.[150] In March 2014, Metallica began a tour called \"Metallica By Request\", in which fans request songs for the band to perform.[151] A new song, titled \"Lords of Summer\" was written for the concerts and released as a \"first take\" demo in June 2014.[152] In June 2014, the band headlined the Glastonbury Festival in an attempt to attract new fans. Ulrich said, \"We have one shot, you never know if you'll be invited back\".[153] In November 2014, Metallica performed at the closing ceremony of BlizzCon 2014.[154] In January 2015, Metallica announced a \"Metallica Night\" with the San Jose Sharks, which featured a Q&A session with the band and a charity auction benefiting the San Francisco Bay Chapter of the Sierra Club, but no performances.[155] They were announced to headline Lollapalooza in March 2015, returning to perform there for the first time in 20 years.[156] On May 2, 2015, Metallica performed their third annual Metallica Day at AT&T Park.[157] Metallica were also announced to play at X Games for the first time at X Games Austin 2015 in Austin, Texas.[158] On June 14, 2015, Hetfield and Hammett performed The Star-Spangled Banner live via electric guitars prior to game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California.[159][160][161] In late October, the band unveiled a new website with an introduction from Ulrich containing footage from the studio of the band working on new material.[162] On November 2, Metallica were announced to play \"The Night Before\" Super Bowl 50 at AT&T Park.[163] Metallica announced they would be opening the U.S. Bank Stadium on August 20, 2016, with Avenged Sevenfold and Volbeat as support.\n\nIn April 2016, during the week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its ambassador for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had played a part in the amount of time that it had taken to write and record the album. \"The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things.\" Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. \"Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016\".[164] On August 18, 2016, the band announced via their website that their tenth studio album, Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, would be released worldwide on November 18, 2016, via their independent label, Blackened Recordings.

There's no shortage of original ideas, that's the beauty of being in this band.\" He estimated that the album would be released \"a lot sooner than the previous two did... this time around I think we'll be able to jump on it a lot quicker and jump in the studio and start working. We've all vowed to get this one going sooner than later.\"[173] In an interview with Australian magazine Mixdown the following month, Hammett said that the band had tentative plans to enter the studio after the conclusion of its WorldWired Tour. He stated, \"We're in our third year since Hardwired. Maybe we can get a bit more focus and go into the studio a bit sooner.\" After not contributing any writing to Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, Hammett said regarding his ideas for the new album, \"I have a ton of material. I've over-compensated, so I'm ready to go anytime.\"[174]\n\nIn March 2019, Metallica announced that its WorldWired Tour would continue into Australia and New Zealand in October with Slipknot in support.[175][176] Later that month, the band announced that it would perform at the grand opening of San Francisco's new Chase Center with the San Francisco Symphony in September to celebrate the twenty-year anniversary of S&M.[177] The commemorative shows, titled S&M2, were screened in more than 3,000 theaters worldwide on October 9;[178][179] the event featured arrangements from the original S&M concerts as well as new arrangements for songs recorded since then[178][179] and a cover of the Alexander Mosolov piece Iron Foundry,[180] and were conducted by Edwin Outwater and San Francisco Symphony music director Michael Tilson Thomas.[181] S&M2 went on to earn $5.5\u00a0million at the box office, making it the biggest global rock event cinema release of all time; a second screening was later announced for October 30 as a result.[182][183][184] In August 2020, the band announced that they would release the S&M2 performances as an album, DVD and box set.[185][186]\n\nIn July 2019, Metallica announced a set of South American tour dates for April 2020 with Greta Van Fleet in support.[187][188] In September, ahead of that year's Global Citizen Festival, it was announced that Metallica would perform at the following year's festival in September 2020 alongside artists such as Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus and Coldplay, in what would be the final event of Global Poverty Project's year-long Global Goal Live: The Possible Dream campaign.[189] The following day, on September 27, Metallica announced that Hetfield had re-entered a rehabilitation program and that its Australia/New Zealand tour would be postponed.[190][191][192] In a statement by Ulrich, Hammett and Trujillo, the band spoke of the devastation of the news, saying that Hetfield \"[had] been struggling with addiction on and off for many years\" and that all tickets would be fully refunded.[190][191][192] Ulrich later added that Hetfield was \"in the process of healing himself\", and that the band hoped to return to Australia and New Zealand in 2020.[193] The band's other commitments, including a benefit concert in March 2020, were still expected to continue as planned;[190] a further five US festival appearances were announced in October.[194] These shows were later postponed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support Hetfield's recovery.[195][196]\n\nIn March 2020, the band began a series on YouTube and Facebook called #MetallicaMondays, where they streamed full archived shows every Monday to relieve boredom while staying home and social distancing amid the pandemic.[197][198] In May 2020, while in quarantine, Metallica performed a virtual acoustic version of \"Blackened\",[199] titled \"Blackened 2020\", which was later made available for download.[200]\n\nIn an interview with Marc Benioff in April 2020, Ulrich stated that Metallica could work on its next studio album while in quarantine.[201] Trujillo told The Vinyl Guide in June that the band was \"excited about cultivating new ideas\" for its new album. \"We communicate every week, which is really great, so we have our connection intact [...] what we've started doing is basically just really concentrating on our home studios and being creative from our homes and navigating through ideas and building on new ideas. And that's where we're at right now\". He also said that the band was working towards eventually entering a studio to record the album.[202]\n\nOn August 10, 2020, Metallica played a show at Gundlach-Bundschu Winery in Sonoma, California, which was only attended by a few crew members, and it was recorded and played for drive-in movies across the U.S. and Canada on August 29.[203]\n\nIn May 2021, the band announced that they would do one more #MetallicaMondays on May 24 to benefit their All Within My Hands Foundation.[204] The concert dates to September 6, 2018, in Lincoln, Nebraska.[204] On Labor Day, September 6, 2021, the band's All Within My Hands Foundation raised $377,450. Metallica teamed up with workwear brand Carhartt on the initiative, with the clothing brand donating all of their sales proceeds on the holiday to the band's Metallica Scholars initiative, which provides opportunities to people interested in pursuing essential workforce jobs.[205]\n\nOn November 28, 2022, the band released the single \"Lux \u00c6terna\".[206][207] On January 19, 2023, Metallica released the second single titled \"Screaming Suicide\".[208][209] On March 1, 2023, Metallica released the third single titled \"If Darkness Had a Son\".[210][211] On March 30, 2023, Metallica released a music video for the album's title track, \"72 Seasons\".[212][213] The band released their eleventh studio album 72 Seasons on April 14, 2023.[214] Metallica promoted the album with a two-and-a-half-year-long tour, titled the M72 World Tour, which began on April 27, 2023, in Amsterdam and is set to conclude on November 19, 2025, in Auckland.[215][216]\n\nIn an interview on Loudwire Nights radio program in April 2023, Ulrich stated that \"there [were] some ideas [Metallica] could start with\" for the follow-up to 72 Seasons, adding, \"I'm looking forward to going live and being in sharing mode for the next couple of years. The beauty of being with these guys, I kind of joke, James writes more riffs when he's tuning his guitar than most people do in a lifetime. That's the beauty of being in band with these guys and I'm eternally grateful. I'm dumbfounded by it.\" When asked about \"leftovers\" that could be used for the next Metallica album, Ulrich said, \"There's always a few riffs in the riff tank.\"[217] In May 2024, Hetfield confirmed that he has been \"writing lots of music, playing guitar pretty much every day.\"[218]\n\nMetallica played thrash[222] and speed metal[224] on their first four albums before changing their sound to traditional heavy metal[227] on 1991's Black Album. Load and Reload, released in 1996 and 1997 respectively, saw the band move towards hard rock.[228] 2008's Death Magnetic saw them returning to a more thrash-influenced sound.[229]\n\nMetallica was influenced by early heavy metal and hard rock bands and artists Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Ted Nugent, AC/DC, Rush, Aerosmith, and Judas Priest[230] and by new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands Raven,[231] Venom, Mot\u00f6rhead, Saxon, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, and Iron Maiden as well as European bands Scorpions,[230] Accept,[232] and Mercyful Fate.[233] Early punk rock bands Ramones, Sex Pistols, and the Misfits also influenced Metallica's style as did post-punk band Killing Joke[234] and hardcore punk acts Discharge,[235] GBH,[236] and Suicidal Tendencies.[237] Lars Ulrich has cited Iron Maiden as probably the biggest influence on Metallica's career.[238] The band's early releases contained fast tempos, harmonized leads, and nine-minute instrumental tracks. Steve Huey of AllMusic said Ride the Lightning featured \"extended, progressive epics; tight, concise groove-rockers\".[239] He also said Metallica expanded its compositional technique and range of expression to take on a more aggressive approach in following releases, and lyrics dealt with personal and socially conscious issues.[239] Religious and military leaders, rage, insanity, monsters, and drugs\u2014among other themes\u2014were explored on Master of Puppets.[240]\n\nIn 1991, Huey said Metallica with new producer Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music for a more commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences.[241] Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range.[242] The change in direction proved commercially successful; Metallica was the band's first album to peak at number one on the Billboard\u00a0200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early-1990s. In Load\u2014an album that has been described as having \"an almost alternative rock\" approach\u2014the band changed musical direction again and focused on non-metal influences.[243] Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of Load, and headlining the Lollapalooza festival of 1996.[58] David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the move as \"goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash\", and called Load the heaviest record of 1996.[58] With the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.[243]\n\nSt. Anger marked another large change in the band's sound. Guitar solos were excluded from the album, leaving a \"raw and unpolished sound\".[74] The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. New York Magazine's Ethan Brown said it \"reverberates with a thwong\". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, claustrophobia, impending doom, and religious hypocrisy.[244][245] At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album Death Magnetic, the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos.[246] As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, Death Magnetic was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics about suicide and redemption.[247]\n\nIn February 2017, Metallica launched All Within My Hands Foundation, \"dedicated to creating sustainable communities by supporting workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services\". For example, the group works with various selected charities to organize volunteer projects at food banks. It also works with workforce training institutions on its Metallica Scholars grant program to help chosen students learn new trade skills.[248] The Foundation has also donated and further raised funds for World Central Kitchen's Ukraine war relief efforts[249][250] and granted $200,000 for relief efforts after the destructive August 2023 Maui, Hawaii fire.[251] The band has also performed fundraising concerts for the Foundation.[252]\n\nMetallica has become one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time and is credited as one of the \"big four\" of thrash metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth.[253] The band has sold more than 125\u00a0million records worldwide,[3] including an RIAA-certified 66\u00a0million and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 58\u00a0million in the US, making Metallica one of the most commercially successful bands of all time.[254][255] The writers of The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll said Metallica gave heavy metal \"a much-needed charge\".[256] Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Greg Prato of Allmusic said Metallica \"expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions\", and called the band \"easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s, responsible for bringing the music back to Earth\".[257]\n\nJonathan Davis of Korn said he respects Metallica as his favorite band; he said, \"I love that they've done things their own way and they've persevered over the years and they're still relevant to this day. I think they're one of the greatest bands ever.\"[258] Godsmack drummer Shannon Larkin said Metallica has been the biggest influence on the band, stating, \"they really changed my life when I was 16 years old\u2014I'd never heard anything that heavy\".[259] Chuck Billy of Testament has also cited Metallica as an influence on the band, as well as Hetfield as \"an inspiration with clever lyrics\"; he added, \"When I first started hearing Metallica it was something new to me the way his cadence of vocal styles sang to the music.\"[260][261] Vocalist and guitarist Robb Flynn of Machine Head said that when creating the band's 2007 album, The Blackening, \"What we mean is an album that has the power, influence and epic grandeur of that album Master of Puppets\u2014and the staying power\u2014a timeless record like that\".[262] Gojira lead guitarist Christian Andreu said it was while listening to Ride the Lightning that he started making music; saying \"we find on the album 'Fade to Black', 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', emblematic pieces\".[263] Trivium guitarists Corey Beaulieu and Matt Heafy said that when they heard Metallica they wanted to start playing guitar.[264][265] M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold said touring with Metallica was the band's career highlight, and said, \"Selling tons of records and playing huge shows will never compare to meeting your idols Metallica\".[266] God Forbid guitarists Doc and Dallas Coyle were inspired by Metallica as they grew up, and the band's bassist John Outcalt admires Burton as a \"rocker\".[267] Ill Ni\u00f1o drummer Dave Chavarri said he finds early Metallica releases are \"heavy, raw, rebellious. It said, 'fuck you'\",[268] and Adema drummer Kris Kohls said the band is influenced by Metallica.[269]\n\nOn April 4, 2009, Metallica were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. They entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the second year they were eligible and first year they were nominated. Metallica's induction into the Hall included its current lineup, James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Robert Trujillo, and Lars Ulrich, and former members Jason Newsted and Cliff Burton.[270]\n\nMTV ranked Metallica the third \"Greatest Heavy Metal Band in History\".[258] Metallica was ranked 42nd on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\",[271] was listed fifth on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\",[272] and the band was number one on VH1's \"20 Greatest Metal Bands\" list.[273] Rolling Stone placed the band 61st on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time\";[274] its albums Master of Puppets and Metallica were ranked at numbers 167 and 252 respectively on the magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[275] Master of Puppets was named in Q Magazine's \"50 Heaviest Albums of All Time\",[276] and was ranked number one on IGN's \"Top 25 Metal Albums\",[277] and number one on Metal-rules.com's \"Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums\" list.[278] \"Enter Sandman\" was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".[279]\n\nKerrang! released a tribute album titled Master of Puppets: Remastered with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Master of Puppets. The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Trivium\u2014all of which are influenced by Metallica. At least 15 Metallica tribute albums have been released. On September 10, 2006, Metallica guest starred on The Simpsons' eighteenth-season premiere, \"The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer\".[280] Hammett's and Hetfield's voices were used in three episodes of the animated television series Metalocalypse.[281] Finnish cello metal band Apocalyptica released a tribute album titled Plays Metallica by Four Cellos, which features eight Metallica songs played on cellos. A parody band named Beatallica plays music using a combination of The Beatles and Metallica songs. Beatallica faced legal troubles when Sony, which owns The Beatles' catalog, issued a cease and desist order, claiming \"substantial and irreparable injury\" and ordering the group to pay damages. Ulrich, a fan of Beatallica, asked Metallica's lawyer Peter Paterno to help settle the case.[282]\n\nOn March 7, 1999, Metallica was inducted into the San Francisco Walk of Fame. The mayor of San Francisco, Willie Brown, proclaimed the day \"Official Metallica Day\".[283] The band was awarded the MTV Icon award in 2003, and a concert paying tribute to the band with artists performing its songs was held. Performances included Sum 41 and a medley of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", \"Enter Sandman\", and \"Master of Puppets\". Staind covered \"Nothing Else Matters\", Avril Lavigne played \"Fuel\", hip-hop artist Snoop Dogg performed \"Sad but True\", Korn played \"One\", and Limp Bizkit performed \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\".[284]\n\nThe Guitar Hero video game series included several of Metallica's songs. \"One\" was used in Guitar Hero III. The album Death Magnetic was later released as purchasable, downloadable content for the game. \"Trapped Under Ice\" was featured in the sequel, Guitar Hero World Tour. In 2009, Metallica collaborated with the game's developers to make Guitar Hero: Metallica, which included a number of Metallica's songs. Harmonix' video game series Rock Band included \"Enter Sandman\" and \"Battery\"; \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Blackened\", and \"...And Justice for All\" were released as downloadable tracks. In 2013, due to expiring content licenses, \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Blackened\", and \"...And Justice for All\" are no longer available for download.[285] Fortnite Festival, a 2023 rhythm game developed by Harmonix as part of Fortnite, held a Metallica-centric season from June to August 2024 which included \"One\", \"Lux \u00c6terna\", and \"Master of Puppets\". Metallica also performed virtually in Fortnite in \"Metallica: Fuel. Fire. Fury.\", with cosmetics based on Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett and Trujillo being added to the game.[286][287]\n\nIn October 2020, Miley Cyrus announced that she was planning on recording a Metallica covers album and on January 7, 2021, she announced that she has recorded a cover version of \"Nothing Else Matters\" that would feature Elton John on piano, drummer Chad Smith from Red Hot Chili Peppers and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. This version was produced by Andrew Watt, and was released as a promotional single for the tribute album The Metallica Blacklist.[288][289]\n\nFormer lead guitarist and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine has been involved in a historic feud with Metallica. During his time as a founding member during the first two years of the band, Mustaine's tenure was marred by his alcoholism and even a physical altercation with James Hetfield.[290] Mustaine continued to make numerous inflammatory statements against his former band in the press due to buried tension primarily stemming from his firing in 1983 among other issues such as existing songwriting credits across Metallica's first three albums.[291][292] By the late 1980s, it was believed that the feud had largely subsided; later confirmed after Megadeth were hired to open for Metallica on numerous European dates in 1993.[293] Despite this, Mustaine expressed his anger at Metallica during his appearance in the band's documentary Metallica: Some Kind of Monster,[294] in a scene he later disapproved of as he felt he was mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting.[295] The two bands would again find themselves on friendlier terms in 2011 when they took part in the lauded 'Big 4 Tour', alongside Slayer and Anthrax.[296] That same year, Mustaine took part in Metallica's exclusive 30th anniversary show in San Francisco which invited other former members: Ron McGovney, Lloyd Grant, and Jason Newsted.[297]\n\nOften clashing during the early 1980s, both bands were fighting for dominance in the Los Angeles rock scene during Metallica's early years prior to their relocation to the Bay Area. Both James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich expressed their hatred of the hair metal scene in Los Angeles during the time and frequently attacked multiple up-and-coming local bands in multiple interviews, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.[298] Ulrich and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's bassist Nikki Sixx had allegedly been involved in a spat prior to a show at the Troubadour in Hollywood in 1982. Though despite their public disdain for glam metal, Metallica were impressed by the production and commercial success of Dr. Feelgood in 1989, later hiring the album's producer Bob Rock to produce their self-titled fifth album in 1991. Several years later; both Sixx and Ulrich would reignite the feud after Ulrich accused M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce of performing to a backing track at the 1997 American Music Awards. Sixx responded via an online forum in which he insulted numerous band members and also attacked Metallica's then-recent album Load.[299][300] Despite this, Sixx would praise Metallica's then-latest album St. Anger during a 2003 interview, contrary to the negative attention it received upon release.[301] In 2006, both M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce drummer Tommy Lee, and former bassist Jason Newsted took part in a reality show entitled Rock Star: Supernova as they would both participate in creating a supergroup while the show's premise revolved around finding a frontman via contest. During a 2011 meet-and-greet in Mexico City, Hetfield was approached by a fan attacking M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce due to their public image and frequent appearances in tabloids. Hetfield refused to directly respond to the fan's comments towards M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce but laughed in his insults toward the band.[302] In 2015, drummer Lee reignited the feud when he tweeted a picture of Ulrich with the words \"Straight Outta Tempo\" superimposed over his face. Following the post by Lee, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce singer Vince Neil had stated online that he was unaware of the feud with Metallica; however, during a later interview with an Oregon radio show, Neil was again asked about the band's current relationship with Metallica and hung up on the show's host.[303] Things were alleged to have calmed down by 2017, when Hetfield appeared on Sixx's radio show 'Sixx Sense'.[304] During an interview in 2021, Sixx applauded Metallica's longevity and praised several of their releases during an interview.[305]\n\nFollowing his hiring in 1986, former bassist Jason Newsted had regularly experienced incidents of hazing and a perceived lack of acceptance from his bandmates despite his strong efforts in a majority of the band's live performances.[306] Many fans and outlets cite the band's fourth album's unusual mixing to drown the bass tracks as a possible effort by Hetfield and Ulrich to minimize Newsted's involvement.[307][308] This sentiment was further exacerbated by the fact that Newsted was only given songwriting credits on three songs during his 14-year span in the band which also saw him perform on four studio albums.[309] Tensions between Hetfield and Newsted reached a breaking point in 2000 after Hetfield repeatedly blocked Newsted's request to venture into his side project Echobrain.[310][311] Discussions broke down and Newsted abruptly left the band in January 2001 prior to the recording of St. Anger.[312] Despite Newsted's animosity surrounding his decision, he was later inducted into the hall of fame as a member of the band in 2009 and also appeared at the band's 30th anniversary show in San Francisco in 2011. In August 2021, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the release of the band's self-titled album, Newsted was given a box set of the reissue to open for an unboxing video, which was uploaded to the band's YouTube channel.[313][314]\n\nCurrent members\n\nSession/touring musicians\n\nFormer members\n\n\n\nStudio albums\n\nGrammy Awards[315]\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden", "content": "\n\nIron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. Although fluid in the early years of the band, the line-up for most of the band's history has consisted of Harris, lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain, and guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers. As pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden released a series of UK and US Platinum and Gold albums, including 1980's debut album, 1981's Killers, and 1982's The Number of the Beast \u2013 its first album with Dickinson, who in 1981 replaced Paul Di'Anno as lead singer. The addition of Dickinson was a turning point in their career, establishing them as one of heavy metal's most important bands. The Number of the Beast is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.\n\nAfter some turbulence in the 1990s, the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999 saw the band undergo a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours. Their three most recent albums \u2014 The Final Frontier (2010), The Book of Souls (2015), and Senjutsu (2021) \u2014 have all reached number\u00a01 in more than 25 countries. Iron Maiden have sold over 130\u00a0million copies of their albums worldwide and have obtained over\u00a0600 certifications. The band is considered to be one of the most influential and revered heavy metal bands of all time. They have received multiple industry awards, including the Grammy and Brit Awards.\n\nThe band have released 41 albums, including 17 studio albums, 13 live albums, four EPs and seven compilations. They have also released 47 singles and 20 video albums, and two video games. Iron Maiden's lyrics cover such topics as history, literature, war, mythology, dark fantasy, science fiction, society and religion. As of October\u00a02019[update], the band have played 2,500 live shows. For over 40\u00a0years the band have featured their signature mascot, \"Eddie\", on the covers of almost all of their releases.\n\nIron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975, by bassist Steve Harris shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of The Man in the Iron Mask from the novel by Alexandre Dumas, as the title reminded him of the iron maiden torture device.[2] They originally used the name Ash Mountain, but most of the band members preferred the name Iron Maiden. After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976,[3] before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in Maryland, Stratford.[4] The original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist Paul Day being the first to go as, according to Harris, he lacked \"energy or charisma on stage\".[5] He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a Kiss fan who used makeup and fake blood during live performances[5] and had earlier played with Harris and Doug Sampson in the band Smiler.[6] Wilcock's friend, guitarist Dave Murray, was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.[7] Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976,[7] though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-serving members and have performed on all of their releases.\n\nIron Maiden recruited another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.[8] Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,[9] as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.[3] A new line-up was put together, including future Cutting Crew member Tony Moore on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar and drummer Barry Purkis (better known today as Thunderstick). After a single gig with the band in January 1978, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided keyboards did not suit the band's sound.[10] Dave Murray rejoined in late March 1978, and when Terry Wapram disapproved he was sacked. A few weeks later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, with Wapram, and drummer Barry Purkis also left. Former Smiler drummer Doug Sampson was at Dennis' and Thunderstick's last gig, and joined the band afterwards.\n\nHarris, Murray and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.[11] A chance meeting at the Red Lion, a pub in Leytonstone, in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno.[12] Steve Harris said, \"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge\".[13] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult\".[14]\n\nOn New Year's Eve, 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a four-song demo at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.[15] Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs,[15] the band gave a copy to Neal Kay, who, at the time, was managing a heavy metal club called \"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\".[16] After hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \"Prowler\", eventually went to number\u00a01 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine.[17] A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager.[18] As Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club.[19] Featuring only three tracks (one song, \"Strange World\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production),[20] all 5,000 copies sold out within weeks.[17]\n\nIn December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with EMI[21] and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, Adrian Smith of Urchin, to join the group as their second guitarist.[22] Busy with his own band, Smith declined and Dennis Stratton was hired instead.[23] Shortly after, Doug Sampson left due to health issues and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.[24] Iron Maiden's first appearance on an EMI album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \"Sanctuary\" and \"Wrathchild\".[25] The release led to a tour including several other bands linked with the new wave of British heavy metal movement.[26]\n\nIron Maiden released their self-titled album in 1980, which debuted at number\u00a04 in the UK Albums Chart.[27] In addition to the title track, the album included other early favourites such as \"Running Free\", \"Transylvania\", \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Sanctuary\" \u2013 which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a headline tour of the UK, before opening for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked Tour's European leg as well as supporting Judas Priest on select dates. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,[28] and was replaced by Smith in October 1980. In December, the band played at the Rainbow Theatre in London, where their first live video was filmed. Live at the Rainbow was released in May 1981, and \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Wrathchild\" from this video received heavy rotation on MTV during its first hours on the air as the first metal videos ever.[29][30][31]\n\nIn 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, Killers. Although many tracks were written prior to their debut release, it had two new songs: \"Prodigal Son\" and \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\"[32] (the latter's title was taken from the short story by Edgar Allan Poe).[33] Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,[34] the band hired veteran producer Martin Birch,[35] who would continue to work with Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.[36] The record was followed by the band's first world tour with their debut performance in the United States opening for Judas Priest at The Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas. Killers marked the band's USA album charts debut, reaching number\u00a078 on the Billboard 200,[37] and they booked 132 shows to promote the album, including their first concert in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.[38] During the summer, Iron Maiden played several festivals in Europe, including at the Golden Summernights 1981 festivals at Zeppelinfeld in Nuremberg in front of 100,000 people.[30]\n\nBy 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating increasingly erratic behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage,[3] about which Di'Anno comments, \"It wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day\u00a0... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much\".[39] Di'Anno was dismissed following the Killer World Tour[40] with the band already having selected his replacement.[41] After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival,[42] Bruce Dickinson, formerly of Samson, auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.[41] The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy and a one-off show at the Rainbow Theatre in the UK.[40] For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played \"Children of the Damned\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\", introducing fans to their new material.[43]\n\nIn 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, The Number of the Beast, which became the band's first number\u00a01 record on the UK Albums Chart,[44] was a Top 10 hit in many other countries, and reached number\u00a033 on the Billboard 200.[37][45] At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a \"moral contribution\" to \"Children of the Damned\", \"The Prisoner\", and \"Run to the Hills\".[46] The band embarked on a world tour, dubbed The Beast on the Road, with shows in North America, Japan, Australia and Europe, including a headline appearance for 40,000 people at the Reading Festival. Iron Maiden played 188 shows in 10 months.[30] The Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed Iron Maiden were Satanic because of the new album's title track and \"demonic\" cover art,[45] and a group of Christian activists destroyed Iron Maiden records in protest.[47] Dickinson later said the band treated this as \"silliness\"[48] and the demonstrations in fact gave them \"loads of publicity\".[3] The Number of the Beast sold 2.5 million copies in its first year, 14 million by 2010, and 20 million by 2022.[49][50][51][52]\n\nIn December 1982, drummer Clive Burr was fired from the band and replaced by Nicko McBrain, who previously played for Trust.[53] Although Harris said the dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities,[54] Burr later claimed he was unfairly ousted from the band.[55] The band then recorded the first of three consecutive albums at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas.[56] In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, Piece of Mind, which reached the number\u00a03 spot in the UK[57] and number\u00a014 on the Billboard 200.[37] Piece of Mind features the singles \"The Trooper\" and \"Flight of Icarus\", the latter being one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.[58] Iron Maiden played 147 concerts in Europe and North America as a part of the World Piece Tour. This was also their first major North American tour as headliners, selling out Madison Square Garden with a crowd of 20,000.[30][59]\n\nAfter the success of Piece of Mind and its supporting tour, the band released their fifth studio album, Powerslave, on 9 September 1984. The album features the singles \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" and \"Aces High\", the title track, and \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (based on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem Rime of the Ancient Mariner).[60] Powerslave was another chart success, reaching number\u00a012 on the Billboard 200[37] and eventually number\u00a01 in the UK.[61][62][63] The band's fifth studio album sold over 4 million copies in its first year after the premiere.[64] The tour following the album, called World Slavery Tour, was the band's largest to date with 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,[60] playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.[65][66] Many shows were played back to back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts at Long Beach Arena for a combined audience of 54,000 fans.[67] Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined the Rock in Rio festival with Queen for an audience estimated at 350,000\u2013500,000 people.[68][69] The tour started in August 1984 with five shows in Poland. Iron Maiden were the first Western artists to bring full-scale production behind the Iron Curtain. The band's third official video, entitled Behind the Iron Curtain, was released in October 1984. The World Slavery Tour documentary brought footage of the band touring Eastern Europe in 1984, performing shows in the countries visited, Behind the Iron Curtain was the first documentary ever published by a Western artist that showed them touring the countries of Eastern Bloc. The documentary movie was broadcast by MTV and local TV stations around the world.[70]\n\nThe tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).[71] This was the first substantial touring break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,[72] with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.[73] In October 1985, Iron Maiden released the double live album and home video, Live After Death. A critical and commercial success, it peaked at number\u00a019 on the Billboard 200[37] and number\u00a02 in the UK.[74] The album was recorded at Long Beach Arena and also features additional tracks from four nights at London's Hammersmith Apollo.[75][76] In November 1985, Iron Maiden were named the best rock and metal band in the world and awarded at Public Choice International.[77]\n\nReturning from their time off, the band added different musical elements to their 1986 studio album, Somewhere in Time. These focused on synthesised bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.[78] The release performed well across the world, particularly the single \"Wasted Years\", but included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.[79] The album was the band's biggest American chart success to date, reaching number\u00a011 on the Billboard 200[37] and number\u00a02 in the UK charts.[74][80] The Somewhere on Tour was also a success. The band played 157 shows for over two and a half million fans, including eighty-one shows in North America. Once again, Iron Maiden visited Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia to play for tens of thousands of fans in each country.[81] The experimentation evident on Somewhere in Time continued on their next album, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which was released in 1988. A concept album recorded at Musicland Studios in Munich[82] and based on the 1987 novel Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card,[83] it was the band's first record to include keyboards, which were performed by Harris and Smith.[83] Dickinson's enthusiasm was also renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.[84] Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit number\u00a01 in the UK charts[85] and reached number\u00a012 on the Billboard 200.[37]\n\nDuring the following tour, the band headlined the Monsters of Rock festival at Donington Park on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history (107,000).[86] The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the NEC Arena, Birmingham, recorded for a live video, entitled Maiden England. The video debuted at top spots of worldwide music videos charts.[87] In May, the group set out on a supporting tour, which saw them perform 103 shows to well over two million people worldwide over seven months.[88] To recreate the album's keyboards onstage throughout the tour, the group recruited Michael Kenney, Steve Harris' bass technician; Kenney has served as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums.[89]\n\nDuring a break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band ASAP, entitled Silver and Gold.[90] Vocalist Bruce Dickinson also began work on a solo album with former Gillan guitarist Janick Gers, releasing Tattooed Millionaire in 1990,[91] followed by a tour.[92] At the same time, to mark the band's 10-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, The First Ten Years, a series of 10 CDs and double 12-inch singles. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one by one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.[30]\n\nIron Maiden then began work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris regarding the direction the band should be taking. Smith disagreed with the \"stripped down\" style they were leaning towards.[93] Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith and became the band's first new member in seven years.[92] The album No Prayer for the Dying was released in October 1990.[94] It contained the hit singles \"Holy Smoke\" and \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", the band's first \u2013 and, to date, only \u2013 UK Singles Chart number\u00a01, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo project for the soundtrack of A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.[95] Iron Maiden's eighth studio album debuted at number\u00a02 on the UK albums chart[95] and number\u00a017 on the Billboard 200.[37] No Prayer for the Dying was a return to their musical roots, especially in the simplicity of composition.[30][93] The No Prayer on the Road tour was booked for 120 shows in Europe, North America, and Japan. Thirty-three shows in continental Europe were sold out with a reported 530,000 fans attending.[96] In total, Iron Maiden played for some two million fans.[97][96]\n\nAfter another break, the band recorded their next studio album, Fear of the Dark, which was released in 1992. The title track became a regular part of the band's concert setlists. Achieving their third number\u00a01 on the UK albums chart and number\u00a012 on the Billboard 200,[37][98] the release also included the number\u00a02 single \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", the number\u00a021 single \"From Here to Eternity\", and the softer \"Wasting Love\".[99] The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The extensive worldwide tour that followed included their first-ever Latin American leg, although Christian organisations prevented Iron Maiden from performing in Chile and accused them of being \"emissaries of satanic propaganda\",[100] and headlining the Monsters of Rock festivals in seven European countries.[101] Iron Maiden's second performance at Donington Park, for a sold-out audience of 75,000,[102][103] was filmed for the audio and video release Live at Donington and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform \"Running Free\".[103] The tour also saw conflicts between Bruce Dickinson and rest of the band.[30][104]\n\nIn 1993, Dickinson left the band to pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a farewell tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package).[105] The first, A Real Live One, was released in March 1993 and featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and the second, A Real Dead One, was released after Dickinson left the band and featured songs from 1980 to 1984. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.[106] Dickinson denied he was under-performing, saying it was impossible to \"make like Mr. Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right\", and that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.[107] Dickinson played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993. The show was filmed, broadcast by the BBC, MTV and released on video under the name Raising Hell.[108]\n\nIn 1994, the title track from the Fear of the Dark album received a Grammy Awards nomination for \"Best Metal Performance\", a first for Iron Maiden.[109] The band listened to the thousands of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing Blaze Bayley, formerly of the band Wolfsbane, who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.[110] Harris' preferred choice from the outset,[111] Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor and ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.[112]\n\nAfter a three-year hiatus \u2013 a record for the band at the time \u2013 Iron Maiden released their next studio album, The X Factor. The band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK \u2013 debuting at number\u00a08, although it went on to win \"Album of the Year\" awards in France, Spain and Germany.[113] The record included the 11-minute epic \"Sign of the Cross\", the band's longest song since \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", as well as the singles \"Man on the Edge\" (based on the film Falling Down)[114] and \"Lord of the Flies\", based on the novel Lord of the Flies.[115] The release is notable for its \"dark\" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.[116] The band toured for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing their first shows in Israel and South Africa as well as Malta, Bulgaria and Romania in Europe, before concluding in the Americas. The biggest show of the whole tour was a headline appearance for 60,000 people at the Monsters of Rock festival in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.The X Factor sold 1.3 million copies, the lowest sales result since 1981.[117] After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, Best of the Beast. The band's first compilation, it included a new single, \"Virus\", in which the lyrics attack critics who had recently written off the band.[118]\n\nIn 1998, Iron Maiden released Virtual XI, whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date.[119][120] The album peaked at number\u00a016 in the UK, the band's lowest for a new studio record.[121] At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including Live at Donington.[122] Bayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.[123] The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour,[124] although Janick Gers said this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.[125]\n\nThe band entered into talks with Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton in January 1999,[126] along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later.[127] With Gers remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three-guitar line-up (nicknamed \"The Three Amigos\"), and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour.[128] Dubbed The Ed Hunter Tour, it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, Ed Hunter, whose track listing was decided by a poll on the group's website, and also contained a computer game starring Eddie, the band's mascot.[129]\n\nNot satisfied with the results from Harris' Barnyard Studios, located on his property in Essex,[130] which had been used for the last four Iron Maiden studio albums, the band recorded the new release, Brave New World, at Guillaume Tell Studios in Paris, France in November 1999 with producer Kevin Shirley.[131] Iron Maiden continued to find inspiration in movies and books, as shown in songs like \"The Wicker Man\" \u2013 based on the 1973 British cult film The Wicker Man \u2013 and \"Brave New World\" \u2013 a title taken from the Aldous Huxley novel Brave New World.[132] The album revisited the more progressive and melodic sound featured in some earlier recordings, along with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration.[132] The album was a commercial and artistic success.[133][30]\n\nThe reunion world tour that followed had over 100\u00a0dates (including 31 shows of the 1999 tour), and culminated on 19 January 2001 in a show at the Rock in Rio festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played to an audience of over 250,000.[134] While the performance was being produced for a CD and DVD release in March 2002, under the name Rock in Rio,[135] the band took a year off from touring, although they played three consecutive shows at Brixton Academy to raise funds for former drummer Clive Burr, who had recently announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.[136] The band performed two further concerts for Burr's MS Trust Fund charity in 2005,[137] and 2007,[138] before his death in 2013.[139] During the 2000\u20132002 tour, Iron Maiden played 91 shows for over two million people in 33 countries.[140] In addition to their touring success, the band was nominated twice for the annual Grammy Awards[141] and received the International Achievement Award at the 2001 Ivor Novello Awards.[142] In November 2001, a documentary movie about the making of The Number of the Beast album was produced by BBC as a part of the Classic Album series.[143]\n\nFollowing their summer 2003 Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour, with 57 shows in Europe and North America and headlining large festivals such as Roskilde, Heineken Jammin' Festival, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park (combined attendance of 130,000) and the first Download Festival held at Donington Park; a successor to Monsters of Rock,[144] Iron Maiden released Dance of Death, their thirteenth studio album. It met with worldwide critical and commercial success, reaching number\u00a02 on the UK Albums Chart[145] and number\u00a018 on the Billboard 200.[37] Produced by Kevin Shirley, now the band's regular producer, many critics felt this release reached the standard of their earlier efforts.[146] Historical and literary references were present, with \"Monts\u00e9gur\" focussing on the Cathar stronghold conquered in 1244, and \"Paschendale\" relating to the First World War battle.[147]\n\nDuring the Dance of Death Tour 2003\u201304, which began in September 2003, Iron Maiden played 53 shows across Europe, North America, Latin America and Japan.[148] The band's performance at Westfalenhalle, in Dortmund, Germany, was recorded and released in August 2005 as a live album and DVD entitled Death on the Road.[149] In 2005, the band announced the Eddie Rips Up the World Tour, which, tying in with their 2004 DVD entitled The History of Iron Maiden \u2013 Part 1: The Early Days, only featured material from their first four albums.[150] As part of this celebration of their earlier years, \"The Number of the Beast\" single was re-released[151] and went straight to number\u00a03 on the UK Chart.[152] The tour featured many headlining stadium and festival dates, including a performance at Ullevi Stadium in Sweden to an audience of almost 60,000.[153] This concert was also broadcast live on satellite television across Europe to approximately 60 million viewers.[154] The band completed the tour by headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 26\u201328 August,[155] and the RDS Stadium in Ireland on 31 August.[137]\n\nAt the end of 2005, Iron Maiden began work on A Matter of Life and Death, their fourteenth studio album, which was released in autumn 2006. War and religion are recurring themes in the lyrics and the cover artwork.[156] The release was a critical and commercial success, marking the band's first top ten on the Billboard 200 and debuting at number one in the album charts of 13 countries.[157][30] The supporting tour saw mixed critical reception,[158] but included the band's first performance in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival for 25,000 people,[159] followed by a concert in Bangalore Palace Grounds, the first of any heavy metal band in India.[160][159] The band then played a string of European dates, including an appearance at Download Festival, their fourth headline performance at Donington Park,[161] to approximately 80,000 people.[162]\n\nOn 5 September 2007, the band announced their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, tying in with the DVD release of their Live After Death album.[163] The setlist for the tour consisted of songs from the 1980s.[163] They played their first concerts in Costa Rica and Colombia and their first shows in Australia and Puerto Rico since 1992.[164] The tour led to the release of a new compilation album, entitled Somewhere Back in Time, which included a selection of tracks from their 1980 eponymous debut to 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, as well as several live versions from Live After Death.[165] In 2008\u201309 in Latin America the band played 27 concerts for about a million people in total, a record for a heavy rock performer.[30][166] The tour continued with two legs in the US and Europe in the summer of 2008.[167] The sole UK concert took place at Twickenham Stadium, marking the first time the band would headline a stadium in their own country.[168] The 2008 tour was the second highest-grossing tour of the year for a British artist.[169] The final leg included the band's first appearances in Peru and Ecuador, as well as their return to Venezuela and New Zealand after 17 years.[170] The band also played another show in India at the Rock in India festival to a crowd of 20,000. At their concert in S\u00e3o Paulo on 15 March, Dickinson announced on stage that it was the largest non-festival show of their career, with an overall attendance of 100,000\u00a0people.[171][172] The final leg ended in Florida on 2 April after which the band took a break. Overall, the tour reportedly had an attendance of over two and a half million people worldwide over both years.[173] At the 2009 Brit Awards, Iron Maiden won the award for best British live act.[174]\n\nOn 20 January 2009, the band announced they were planning to release a full-length documentary film in select cinemas on 21 April 2009. Entitled Iron Maiden: Flight 666, it documented the first part of the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour (between February and March 2008).[175] Flight 666 was co-produced by Banger Productions and was distributed in cinemas by Arts Alliance Media and EMI, with D&E Entertainment sub-distributing in the US.[176] The film went on to have a Blu-ray, DVD, and CD release in May and June,[173] topping the music DVD charts in 25 countries.[172] In most of them the release went Gold, Platinum or Multi-Platinum.[30]\n\nThe band had begun composing new material and booked studio time in early 2010 with Kevin Shirley producing,[177] and The Final Frontier was announced on 4 March and featured three singles \"The Final Frontier\", \"El Dorado\" and \"Coming Home\", as well as epic, progressive opuses \"Isle of Avalon\", \"The Talisman\" and \"When The Wild Wind Blows\".[178] The album, the band's fifteenth, was released on 16 August[179] to critical acclaim.[180] It was also the band's greatest commercial success to that point, reaching number\u00a01 in twenty-eight countries worldwide,[181] including a debut at number\u00a04 on Billboard 200.\n\nThe album's supporting tour saw the band perform 101 shows across the globe to an estimated audience of over two and a half million,[182] including their first visits to Singapore, Indonesia, and South Korea.[181] \"El Dorado\" won the Best Metal Performance award at the 2011 Grammy Awards, the band's first win after two previous nominations.[183][184] On 15 March, a new compilation to accompany 2009's Somewhere Back in Time was announced.[185] The double disc set covers the period 1990\u20132010 (the band's most recent eight studio albums).[185] In 2012, the band announced a new live album and DVD release entitled En Vivo!, based on footage from the Chile concert. The DVD topped the music video charts around the world.[186][187] In addition to the concert footage, the video release includes an 88-minute tour documentary, entitled Behind The Beast, containing interviews with the band and their crew.[188] In December 2012, one song from the release (\"Blood Brothers\") was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards.[189]\n\nOn 15 February, the band announced their third retrospective Maiden England World Tour 2012\u201314, which was based around the video Maiden England.[190] The tour commenced in North America in the summer of 2012 and was followed by further dates in 2013 and 2014, and included the band's fifth headline performance at Donington Park with 100,000 fans in attendance.[191][186][192] Iron Maiden closed the tour in July 2014 at Sonisphere Festival, Knebworth, having undertaken 100 shows in 32 countries before an estimated audience of more than 2.7 million people.[193][194][30]\n\nThe band's 2015 album, The Book of Souls, was released on 4 September.[195] The band's first original studio album not to be issued by EMI outside North America, following Parlophone's acquisition by Warner Music Group in 2013,[196] it was a critical and commercial success, becoming the band's fifth UK number\u00a01 album[197] and hit number\u00a04 on Billboard 200 in the US. The new release reached the number one position in the album charts of 43 countries.[198] The new record was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios in late summer 2014;[199] its closing song, \"Empire of the Clouds\", penned by Dickinson, surpassed \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (from 1984's Powerslave) as Iron Maiden's longest song, at 18 minutes in length.[195]\n\nIn February 2016, the band embarked on The Book of Souls World Tour, with shows in 35 countries across six continents, including their first performances in China, El Salvador, and Lithuania. It was the band's biggest album tour since 1996.[200] In total, Iron Maiden played 117 shows on six continents for well over two and a half million people.[201][30] The band then launched the Legacy of the Beast World Tour in Europe in 2018,[202] with North and South American shows following in 2019. The tour was inspired by the band's new mobile game and comic series released in 2017, entitled Legacy of the Beast.[203] The tour was received very positively by fans and critics,[204] spanning up to three years with 140 shows, performing to over 3.5 million fans.[205]\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced the rescheduling of nearly one million tickets from 2020, first to 2021, and then to 2022.[30][206] In October 2020, the band announced they would release a live album from the Legacy of the Beast World Tour called Nights of the Dead, Legacy of the Beast: Live in Mexico City. The double concert album was recorded during three sold-out concerts in Mexico City's Palacio de los Deportes for a combined audience of over 70,000 people.[207]\n\nOn 15 July 2021, Iron Maiden released a video for their first song in six years, \"The Writing on the Wall\", which was directed by Nicos Livesey.[208] Four days later, the band announced their seventeenth studio album, Senjutsu, would be released on 3 September 2021.[209][210] Senjutsu eventually reached the top of the best-seller lists in 27 countries,[211][212][213] but it was the band's first album in fifteen years not to reach number one on the UK charts, although it did top the UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts. In total, Senjutsu reached the top three in 55 countries and the top five in 63 countries.[211][212][213][214][215]\n\nOn 1 February 2023, the band received their second nomination for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[216][217] The band started their 25th global tour, The Future Past World Tour, with a concert in Ljubljana in May 2023.[218] On 6 October, the band performed at the Power Trip festival which drew nearly 100,000 people.[219] Throughout the 2023\u201324 world tour, Iron Maiden performed 81 shows for almost two million fans.[220] Following the conclusion of the tour in S\u00e3o Paulo in December 2024, McBrain retired from touring,[221] but would still remain a member of Iron Maiden and be involved with various upcoming band-related projects in the studio.[222] The following day, it was announced that British Lion drummer Simon Dawson would be his touring replacement for any further tours.[223][224]\n\nOn 19 September 2024, the band announced their 26th global tour, Run For Your Lives World Tour, which is set to start in May 2025, to celebrate the band's 50th anniversary and is set to be focused on the band's first nine studio albums.[225]\n\nIron Maiden have received numerous nominations, honours and awards including Grammy Awards[226] and equivalents awards in many countries,[227][228] Brit Awards,[229] Ivor Novello Awards,[230] and Juno Awards.[231] They have ranked highly in many polls of the greatest metal artists of all time.[232][233][234][30] In 2012 The Number of the Beast was voted as Best British Album Ever by the British public as part of Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.[235] Iron Maiden have an exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,[236] and Rock in Rio Wall of Fame.[237]\n\nIron Maiden were inducted into Hollywood RockWalk, BPI Hall of Fame and Kerrang! Hall of Fame.[238] Band's mascot Eddie the Head is a part of the British Music Experience permanent exhibition.[239] In April 2021, the band's former members (Paul Di'Anno, Blaze Bayley, and illustrator Derek Riggs) were inducted into the Metal Hall of Fame.[240] They have twice been nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[241][216]  In January 2023 Iron Maiden were honoured by Royal Mail UK with dedicated postal stamps and cards.[242][243]\n\nIron Maiden have sold over 130\u00a0million copies of their albums worldwide,[244][243] despite little radio or television support.[245] According to many sources all audio-visual catalogue of the band have sold in over 200\u00a0million copies worldwide, including regular albums, singles, compilations, and videos.[246][247][248][249][250] Their third studio album, The Number of the Beast, is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time and the most commercially successful release of the band, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.[251][252][253][254][255] As of 2022 their releases have been certified silver, gold and platinum around 600 times worldwide.[256]\n\nIn 1979\u20131980, visual artist Derek Riggs created the macabre mascot named Eddie The Head. Since then, Eddie has been an integral part of the stage and media image of the group.[257] Originally a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask which would squirt fake blood during their live shows,[258] the character featured on the band's debut album cover, also done by Derek Riggs.[259] Eddie was painted exclusively by Riggs until 1992, at which point the band began using artwork from other artists, including Melvyn Grant.[98]\n\nA large puppet version of Eddie has appeared many times during carnival celebrations in Rio de Janeiro and other South American cities.[260] During the Cavalcade of Magi 2021 in the Spanish city of Cadiz, next to dolls representing characters known from the world of pop culture, there was a huge, inflatable mummy inspired by the image of the Iron Maiden mascot from 1985.[261][262][263]\n\nIron Maiden's distinct logo has adorned all of the band's releases since their debut, 1979's The Soundhouse Tapes EP. The typeface originates with Vic Fair's poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, The Man Who Fell to Earth,[264] also used by Gordon Giltrap, although Steve Harris claims he designed it himself, using his training as an architectural draughtsman.[265]\n\nIron Maiden have influenced numerous artists and bands representing different genres of rock and metal music. Kiss co-founder Paul Stanley said Iron Maiden \"have helped spawn an entire genre of music\" and influenced literally thousands of other artists.[266][267] According to Guitar World, Iron Maiden's music has \"influenced generations of newer metal acts, from legends like Metallica to current stars like Avenged Sevenfold.\"[268] Metallica members Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Jason Newsted have cited Iron Maiden as a major influence on their work.[269][270][271][272] Other bands and artists directly influenced by Iron Maiden include Ghost,[273][274] Avenged Sevenfold,[275] In Flames,[276] Anthrax,[277][278] Exodus,[279] and Alice in Chains.[280]\n\nJournalist Geoff Barton says the band's music constituted an important passage between the classic heavy rock school during the 1960s and 1970s, based on rhythm and blues, and contemporary heavy metal, characterised by sub-genre diversification and stylistic eclecticism.[281] Music journalist G\u00f6tz K\u00fchnemund said \"Iron Maiden were (and still are) the inspiration for all the heavy metal bands we know today because they're an intrinsically heavy metal group. They're equally important for those who play power metal, speed, thrash, death, black, nu metal, metal core and hard rock \u2013 almost every genre.\" The journalist stated the band introduced a DIY approach to all rock music.[282] According to Rock 'n Roll Fantasy Camp the style and attitude of Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain has inspired generations of heavy-metal drummers that followed.[283] Music writer, heavy metal expert and radio broadcaster Scott Penfold stated band's \"influence on the genre is immeasurable, as they not only inspired subsequent generations of metal bands but also revolutionized live shows with their elaborate stage productions, further cementing their status as pioneers of heavy metal.\"[284]\n\nMusic journalist and the writer Neil Daniels said Iron Maiden \"redefined the whole genre blending classic heavy rock influence with punky vibe, twin guitars attack and progressive approach which finally have created the new quality. [The] Band's influence on generations of rock and metal bands cannot be overstated. They elevated metal to an art form, proving that academic and musical inspirations can coexist.\"[257] The band's profile by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame says \"in the 1980s, Iron Maiden released seven high-octane albums that cemented them as one of the greatest rock bands \u2013 creating a blueprint for how heavy metal bands should look, sound and tour.\"[285] According to Metal Hammer Iron Maiden is the second band to Black Sabbath, which has had the most significant impact on metal and heavy rock music.[286]\n\nThe first heavy metal videos broadcast by MTV were the live versions of \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Wrathchild\" taken from the official VHS Live at the Rainbow (Iron Maiden).[287][288] In 1989, Iron Maiden took part in the Rock Aid Armenia project (also known as Live Aid Armenia) - a humanitarian project by the British music industry. The project aimed to raise funds to help people affected by the earthquake in Armenia in 1988.[289]\n\nThe number of releases in tribute to the British band can be estimated in the hundreds, with an extremely wide range of stylistic variants.[290][291] In 2008, Kerrang! released Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden, an album composed of Iron Maiden cover songs performed by Metallica, Machine Head, Dream Theater, Trivium, Coheed and Cambria, Avenged Sevenfold, and other groups influenced by the band.[269] In 2010, Maiden uniteD, an acoustic tribute band consisting of members of Ayreon, Threshold and Within Temptation, released Mind the Acoustic Pieces, a re-interpretation of the entire Piece of Mind album.[292] As of 2021 nearly 200 Iron Maiden cover audio-visual releases exist (each featuring various artists), including piano,[293] electro,[294] string quartet[295] and hip-hop tributes.[296]\n\nIn March 2025, Netflix will release Run to the Hills, a documentary celebrating Iron Maiden's 50th anniversary. Directed by David Morgan, it will explore the band's rise from their early days in London to global heavy metal icons. The exact release date is yet to be confirmed.[297]\n\nThe 1982 release of The Number of the Beast created some controversy for the band. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release.[47] The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later said the groups initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers due to fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes.[298] The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.[100]\n\nThe band have always denied the notion they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video.[69] Steve Harris has since commented that, \"It was mad. They completely got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists.\"[45] Harris has also said that \"The Number of the Beast\" song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching Damien: Omen II,[299] and also influenced by Robert Burns' \"Tam o' Shanter\".[48] The band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born-again Christian since 1999.[300]\n\nFor their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour in 2008 and 2009, Iron Maiden commissioned an Astraeus Airlines Boeing 757 as transport.[301] The aeroplane was converted into a combi configuration, which enabled it to carry the band, their crew and stage production, allowing the group to perform in countries which were previously deemed unreachable logistically.[302] It was also repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery,[302] which the airline decided to retain after receiving positive feedback from customers.[303]\n\nThe aircraft, named \"Ed Force One\" after a competition on the band's website,[304] was flown by Dickinson until 2022,[305] as he was also a commercial airline pilot for Astraeus; the plane also appears in the documentary[306] Iron Maiden: Flight 666.[175] For The Book of Souls World Tour in 2016, the band upgraded to an ex-Air France Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet[307] which allows for more space without the aircraft having to undergo a significant conversion to carry their equipment.[308]\n\nSteve Harris, Iron Maiden's bassist and primary songwriter,[309] has said his influences include Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, Jethro Tull, Thin Lizzy, UFO, Queen, and Wishbone Ash.[310] In 2010 Harris said, \"I think if anyone wants to understand Maiden's early thing, in particular the harmony guitars, all they have to do is listen to Wishbone Ash's Argus album. Thin Lizzy too, but not as much. And then we wanted to have a bit of a prog thing thrown in as well, because I was really into bands like Genesis and Jethro Tull. So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\"[268] In 2004, Harris explained the band's \"heaviness\" was inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\"[311] Harris also developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \"more like a rhythm guitar.\"[312] Harris's bass technique is responsible for the band's galloping style,[313] heard in such songs as \"The Trooper\"[314] and \"Run to the Hills\".[315]\n\nThe band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing styles. Dave Murray is known for his legato technique which, he says, \"evolved naturally. I'd heard Jimi Hendrix using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.\"[316] Stating that he \"was inspired by blues rock rather than metal,\" Adrian Smith was influenced by Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, leading to him becoming a \"melodic player.\"[317] Janick Gers prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by Ritchie Blackmore,[318] which he says is in contrast to Smith's \"rhythmic\" sound.[319]\n\nSinger Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith,[320] has an operatic vocal style, inspired by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill, Ian Anderson and Ian Gillan,[321] and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.[322] Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the Dance of Death album,[323] Harris often relies on him while developing songs. Adrian Smith commented, \"Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns.\"[324]\n\nThroughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, although the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's Somewhere in Time,[94] keyboards on 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son,[84] and an attempt to return to the \"stripped down\" production of their earlier material on 1990's No Prayer for the Dying marked some experimentation.[93] In recent years, however, the band have begun using more progressive elements in their songs,[325] which Steve Harris describes as not progressive \"in the modern sense, but like Dream Theater, more in a 70s way\".[326] According to Harris, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the band's first album which was \"more progressive\",[327] and they would return to this style in 1995's The X Factor, which he states is \"like an extension of Seventh Son..., in the sense of the progressive element to it\".[116] The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material,[268] which AllMusic states was \"clearly drawing from elements of punk rock\",[328] although Harris firmly denies this.[329]\n\nCurrent lineup\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath", "content": "\n\nBlack Sabbath were an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1968 by guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward, bassist Geezer Butler, and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. They are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music.[1] The band helped define the genre with their first three albums Black Sabbath, Paranoid (both 1970), and Master of Reality (1971). Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the band underwent multiple line-up changes, with Iommi being the only constant member throughout its history.\n\nAfter previous iterations of the group \u2013 the Polka Tulk Blues Band, and Earth \u2013 the band settled on the name Black Sabbath in 1969. They distinguished themselves through occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and down-tuned guitars. Signing to Philips Records in November 1969, they released their first single, a cover of the Crow song \"Evil Woman\", in January 1970, and their debut album, Black Sabbath, was released the following month. Though it received a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success, leading to a follow-up record, Paranoid, later that year. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, critics were starting to respond favourably. This album, along with its predecessor Vol. 4 (1972) and its successors Sabotage (1975), Technical Ecstasy (1976) and Never Say Die! (1978), saw the band explore more experimental and progressive styles.\n\nOsbourne first left Black Sabbath in late 1977 and was briefly replaced by Dave Walker. After returning to record Never Say Die!, Osbourne was dismissed from the band a second time in 1979 due to his substance abuse, and was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who recorded three albums with the band: Heaven and Hell (1980), Mob Rules (1981) and the live album Live Evil (1982), the last two featuring drummer Vinny Appice replacing Ward. Following Dio and Appice's departures, Iommi and Butler recorded Born Again (1983) with then-former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan and Ward returning on drums, while the latter was replaced by then-Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan on the subsequent tour. Black Sabbath split in 1984, with Iommi assembling a new version of the band the following year. For the next twelve years, the band endured many personnel changes that included vocalists Glenn Hughes (who appeared on 1986's Seventh Star),[3] Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists; of the vocalists during these years, Martin's tenure was the longest, joining the band in 1987 and recording three studio albums before his initial departure in 1991: The Eternal Idol (1987),[4] Headless Cross (1989),[5] and Tyr (1990).[6] That same year, Iommi reunited with Butler, Dio and Appice to record Dehumanizer (1992), though Dio and Appice had both departed again by the end of 1992. Martin returned as vocalist for two more studio albums, Cross Purposes (1994)[7] and Forbidden (1995),[8] and one live album before the band went on a one-year hiatus during 1996. The original line-up of Iommi, Osbourne, Butler and Ward reunited in 1997, releasing a live album, Reunion, in the following year, and continuing to tour sporadically until 2005, most of which saw Black Sabbath headline Osbourne's annual festival tour Ozzfest. The band went on another hiatus in 2006 when the Mob Rules line-up reunited as Heaven & Hell, touring during the late 2000s and releasing its sole studio album, The Devil You Know, in 2009 before disbanding after Dio's death in the following year. The original line-up of Black Sabbath reunited once again in 2011, though Ward departed prior to the recording of their final studio album and 19th overall, 13 (2013). During their farewell tour, Black Sabbath played its final concert in their home city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017.[9][10] Occasional partial reunions have occurred since, most recently when Osbourne and Iommi performed together at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.[11]\n\nBlack Sabbath have sold over 70 million records worldwide as of 2013, making them one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands. Black Sabbath, together with Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, have been referred to as the \"unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies\".[12] They were ranked by MTV as the \"Greatest Metal Band of All Time\" and placed second on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\" list. Rolling Stone magazine ranked them number 85 on its \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\" list. Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance, and in 2019, the band received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.[13]\n\nFollowing the break-up of their previous band, Mythology, in 1968, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward sought to form a heavy blues rock band in Aston, Birmingham. They enlisted bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, who had played together in a band called Rare Breed, Osbourne having placed an advertisement in a local music shop: \"OZZY ZIG Needs Gig \u2013 has own PA\".[2] The new group was initially named the Polka Tulk Blues Band, the name taken either from a brand of talcum powder[14] or an Indian/Pakistani clothing shop; the exact origin is confused.[15] The Polka Tulk Blues Band included slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips, a childhood friend of Osbourne's, and saxophonist Alan \"Aker\" Clarke. After shortening the name to Polka Tulk, the band again changed their name to Earth (which Osbourne hated)[16] and continued as a four-piece without Phillips and Clarke.[17][18] Iommi became concerned that Phillips and Clarke lacked the necessary dedication and were not taking the band seriously. Rather than asking them to leave, they instead decided to break up and then quietly reformed the band as a four-piece.[19] While the band was performing under the Earth moniker, they recorded several demos written by Norman Haines such as \"The Rebel\", \"When I Came Down\" and \"Song for Jim\",[20] the latter of which being a reference to Jim Simpson, who was a manager for the bands Bakerloo Blues Line and Tea & Symphony, as well as the trumpet player for the group Locomotive. Simpson had recently started a new club named Henry's Blueshouse at The Crown Hotel in Birmingham and offered to let Earth play there after they agreed to waive the usual support band fee in return for free T-shirts.[21] The audience response was positive and Simpson agreed to manage Earth.[22][23]\n\nIn December 1968, Iommi abruptly left Earth to join Jethro Tull.[24] Although his stint with the band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth by the end of the month. \"It just wasn't right, so I left\", Iommi said. \"At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having a leader in the band, which was Ian Anderson's way. When I came back from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it.\"[25]\n\nWhile playing shows in England in 1969, the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth, so they decided to change their name again (this name change would give rise to the well-known debate about the alleged aesthetic influence of Coven, which the British band always denied[26][27]). A cinema across the street from the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 Italian horror film Black Sabbath, starring Boris Karloff and directed by Mario Bava. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was \"strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies\".[28] Following that, Osbourne and Butler wrote the lyrics for a song called \"Black Sabbath\", which was inspired by the work of horror and adventure-story writer Dennis Wheatley,[29][30] along with a vision that Butler had of a black silhouetted figure standing at the foot of his bed.[31] Making use of the musical tritone, also known as \"the Devil's Interval\",[32] the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction,[33][34] a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music and hippie culture. Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford has called the track \"probably the most evil song ever written\".[35] Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969,[36] and made the decision to focus on writing similar material in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films.\n\nThe band's first show as Black Sabbath took place on 30 August 1969 in Workington, England.[19] They were signed to Philips Records in November 1969.[37] They recorded their first single, \"Evil Woman\" (a cover of a song by the band Crow), at Trident Studios. \"Evil Woman\" was released on 9 January 1970 through Philips subsidiary Fontana Records. Later releases were handled by Philips' newly formed progressive rock label, Vertigo Records. \"Evil Woman\" failed to chart.\n\nThe band were afforded two days of studio time in November 1969 to record their debut album with producer Rodger Bain. Iommi recalls recording live: \"We thought, 'We have two days to do it, and one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time; we just put him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff\".[38]\n\nOn 11 November 1969 Black Sabbath recorded a 4-song session for John Peel's Top Gear radio show.[39] The four songs were \"Black Sabbath\", \"N.I.B.\", \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" and \"Sleeping Village\". Broadcast on 29 November 1969, this gave them their first exposure to a UK wide audience.[19]\n\nTheir eponymous debut album Black Sabbath was released on Friday the 13th, February 1970, and reached number eight in the UK Albums Chart. Following its U.S. and Canadian release in May 1970 by Warner Bros. Records, the album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, where it remained for over a year.[40][41] The album was given negative reviews by many critics. Lester Bangs dismissed it in a Rolling Stone review as \"discordant jams with bass and guitar reeling like velocitised speedfreaks all over each other's musical perimeters, yet never quite finding synch\".[42] It sold in substantial numbers despite being panned, giving the band their first mainstream exposure.[43] It has since been certified Platinum in both U.S. by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and in the UK by British Phonographic Industry (BPI),[44][45] and is now generally accepted as the first heavy metal album.[46]\n\nThe band returned to the studio in June 1970, just four months after Black Sabbath was released. The new album was initially set to be named War Pigs after the song \"War Pigs\", which was critical of the Vietnam War; however, Warner changed the title of the album to Paranoid. The album's lead single, \"Paranoid\", was written in the studio at the last minute. Ward explains: \"We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony just played the [Paranoid] guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.\"[47] The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, remaining Black Sabbath's only top 10 hit.[41] The album followed in the UK in October 1970, where, pushed by the success of the \"Paranoid\" single, it reached number one on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe U.S. release was held off until January 1971, as the Black Sabbath album was still on the chart at the time of Paranoid's UK release. The album reached No. 12 in the U.S. in March 1971,[40] and would go on to sell four million copies in the U.S.[44] with virtually no radio airplay.[41] Like Black Sabbath, the album was panned by rock critics of the era, but modern-day reviewers such as AllMusic's Steve Huey cite Paranoid as \"one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time\", which \"defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history\".[48] The album was ranked at number 131 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[49] Paranoid's chart success allowed the band to tour the U.S. for the first time \u2013 their first U.S. show was at a club called Ungano's at 210 West 70th Street in New York City[50] \u2013 and spawned the release of the album's second single, \"Iron Man\". Although the single failed to reach the top 40, it remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs, as well as the band's highest-charting U.S. single until 1998's \"Psycho Man\".[40]\n\nIn February 1971, after a one-off performance at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia,[51] Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of Paranoid, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a \"briefcase full of cash\" to buy drugs.[52] \"We were getting into coke, big time\", Ward explained. \"Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like. It got to the stage where you come up with ideas and forget them, because you were just so out of it.\"[53]\n\nProduction completed in April 1971, and in July the band released Master of Reality, just six months after the U.S. release of Paranoid. The album reached the top 10 in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, and was certified Gold in less than two months,[44] eventually receiving Platinum certification in the 1980s and Double Platinum in the early 21st century.[44] It contained Sabbath's first acoustic songs, alongside fan favourites such as \"Children of the Grave\" and \"Sweet Leaf\".[54] Critical response of the era was generally unfavourable, with Lester Bangs delivering an ambivalent review of Master of Reality in Rolling Stone, describing the closing \"Children of the Grave\" as \"na\u00efve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel \u2013 but in the tradition [of rock 'n' roll] ... The only criterion is excitement, and Black Sabbath's got it\".[55] (In 2003, Rolling Stone would place the album at number 300 on their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.[56])\n\nFollowing the Master of Reality world tour in 1972, the band took their first break in three years. As Ward explained: \"The band started to become very fatigued and very tired. We'd been on the road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think Master of Reality was kind of like the end of an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album.\"[57]\n\nIn June 1972, the band reconvened in Los Angeles to begin work on their next album at the Record Plant. With more time in the studio, the album saw the band experimenting with new textures, such as strings, piano, orchestration and multi-part songs.[58] Recording was plagued with problems, many as a result of substance abuse issues. Struggling to record the song \"Cornucopia\" after \"sitting in the middle of the room, just doing drugs\",[59] Ward was nearly fired. \"I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just ... horrible,\" the drummer said. \"I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like, 'Well, just go home; you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired\".[60] Butler thought that the end product \"was very badly produced, as far as I was concerned. Our then-manager insisted on producing it, so he could claim production costs\".[61]\n\nThe album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4. Ward observed, \"There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title, really\".[62] Vol. 4 was released in September 1972, and while critics were dismissive, it achieved Gold status in less than a month, and was the band's fourth consecutive release to sell a million in the U.S.[44] \"Tomorrow's Dream\" was released as a single \u2013 the band's first since \"Paranoid\" \u2013 but failed to chart.[40]\n\nFollowing an extensive tour of the U.S., in 1973 the band travelled again to Australia, followed by a tour for the first time to New Zealand, before moving onto mainland Europe. \"The band were definitely in their heyday\", recalled Ward, \"in the sense that nobody had burnt out quite yet\".[63]\n\nFollowing the Vol. 4 world tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles to begin work on their next release. Pleased with the Vol. 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and returned to the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a \"giant synthesiser\". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. \"Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Vol. 4, and we really got discontent\", Iommi said. \"Everybody was sitting there waiting for me to come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything\".[64]\n\nAfter a month in Los Angeles with no results, the band opted to return to England. They rented Clearwell Castle in The Forest of Dean. \"We rehearsed in the dungeons and it was really creepy, but it had some atmosphere, it conjured up things and stuff started coming out again\".[65] While working in the dungeon, Iommi stumbled onto the main riff of \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\", which set the tone for the new material. Recorded at Morgan Studios in London by Mike Butcher and building off the stylistic changes introduced on Vol. 4, new songs incorporated synthesisers, strings and complex arrangements. Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman was brought in as a session player, appearing on \"Sabbra Cadabra\".[66]\n\nIn November 1973, Black Sabbath began to receive positive reviews in the mainstream press after the release of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, with Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone calling the album \"an extraordinarily gripping affair\" and \"nothing less than a complete success\".[67] Later reviewers such as AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia cite the album as a \"masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection\", while also displaying \"a newfound sense of finesse and maturity\".[68] The album marked the band's fifth consecutive Platinum-selling album in the U.S.,[44] reaching number four on the UK Albums Chart and number 11 in the U.S.\n\nThe band began a world tour in January 1974, which culminated at the California Jam festival in Ontario, California, on 6 April 1974. Attracting over 200,000 fans, Black Sabbath appeared alongside popular 1970s rock and pop bands Deep Purple, Eagles, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rare Earth, Seals & Crofts, Black Oak Arkansas and Earth, Wind & Fire. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC Television in the U.S., exposing the band to a wider American audience. In the same year, the band shifted management, signing with notorious English manager Don Arden. The move caused a contractual dispute with Black Sabbath's former management, and while on stage in the U.S., Osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation.[64]\n\nBlack Sabbath began work on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, this time with a decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. \"We could've continued and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album \u2013 Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath wasn't a rock album, really\".[69] Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, Sabotage was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with Rolling Stone stating \"Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever\",[70] although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that \"the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate\".[71]\n\nSabotage reached the top 20 in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but was the band's first release not to achieve Platinum status in the U.S., only achieving Gold certification.[44] Although the album's only single \"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\" failed to chart, Sabotage features fan favourites such as \"Hole in the Sky\" and \"Symptom of the Universe\".[71] Black Sabbath toured in support of Sabotage with openers Kiss, but were forced to cut the tour short in November 1975, following a motorcycle accident in which Osbourne ruptured a muscle in his back. In December 1975, the band's record companies released a greatest hits album without input from the band, titled We Sold Our Soul for Rock 'n' Roll. The album charted throughout 1976, eventually selling two million copies in the U.S.[44]\n\nBlack Sabbath began work for their next album at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, in June 1976. To expand their sound, the band added keyboard player Gerald Woodroffe, who also had appeared to a lesser extent on Sabotage. During the recording of Technical Ecstasy, Osbourne admits that he began losing interest in Black Sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians.[50] Recording of Technical Ecstasy was difficult; by the time the album was completed, Osbourne was admitted to Stafford County Asylum in Britain.[50] It was released on 25 September 1976 to mixed reviews, and \u2013 for the first time \u2013 later music critics gave the album less favourable retrospective reviews; two decades after its release, AllMusic gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was \"unravelling at an alarming rate\".[72] The album featured less of the doomy, ominous sound of previous efforts, and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs. Technical Ecstasy failed to reach the top 50 in the U.S. and was the band's second consecutive release not to achieve Platinum status, although it was later certified Gold in 1997.[44] The album included \"Dirty Women\", which remains a live staple, as well as Ward's first lead vocal on the song \"It's Alright\".[72] Touring in support of Technical Ecstasy began in November 1976, with openers Boston and Ted Nugent in the U.S., and completed in Europe with AC/DC in April 1977.[36]\n\nIn late 1977, while in rehearsal for their next album and just days before the band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker, a longtime friend of the band who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band.[73] Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath.[73][74] On 8 January 1978, Walker made his only live performance with Black Sabbath, on vocals, when they played an early version of the song \"Junior's Eyes\" on the BBC Television programme Look! Hear![73] Walker later recalled that, while in Birmingham, he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and came to the conclusion that Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath.[73] \"The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me\", Osbourne said. \"I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out.\"[75] Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band, but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the Look! Hear! footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them.[73]\n\nOsbourne initially set out to form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. \"Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band\", Iommi explained. \"He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick\".[75]\n\nThe band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, writing and recording what would become Never Say Die!. \"It took quite a long time\", Iommi said. \"We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day\".[75] The album was released in September 1978, reaching number 12 in the United Kingdom and number 69 in the U.S. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time, with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's \"unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse\".[76] The album featured the singles \"Never Say Die\" and \"Hard Road\", both of which cracked the top 40 in the United Kingdom. The band also made their second appearance on the BBC's Top of the Pops, performing \"Never Say Die\". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the U.S.[44]\n\nTouring in support of Never Say Die! began in May 1978 with openers Van Halen. Reviewers called Black Sabbath's performance \"tired and uninspired\", a stark contrast to the \"youthful\" performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time.[36] The band filmed a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as Never Say Die. The final show of the tour \u2013 and Osbourne's last appearance with the band until later reunions \u2013 was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on 11 December.\n\nFollowing the tour, Black Sabbath returned to Los Angeles and again rented a house in Bel Air, where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album. The entire band were abusing both alcohol and other drugs, but Iommi says Osbourne \"was on a totally different level altogether\".[19] The band would come up with new song ideas, but Osbourne showed little interest and would refuse to sing them.[19] Pressure from the record label and frustrations with Osbourne's lack of input coming to a head, Iommi made the decision to fire Osbourne in 1979. Iommi believed the only options available were to fire Osbourne or break the band up completely.[19] \"At that time, Ozzy had come to an end\", Iommi said. \"We were all doing a lot of drugs, a lot of coke, a lot of everything, and Ozzy was getting drunk so much at the time. We were supposed to be rehearsing and nothing was happening. It was like, 'Rehearse today? No, we'll do it tomorrow.' It really got so bad that we didn't do anything. It just fizzled out\".[77] Ward, who was close with Osbourne, was chosen by Iommi to break the news to the singer on 27 April 1979.[50] \"I hope I was professional, I might not have been, actually. When I'm drunk I am horrible, I am horrid\", Ward said. \"Alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to Black Sabbath. We were destined to destroy each other. The band were toxic, very toxic\".[78]\n\nSharon Arden (later Sharon Osbourne), daughter of Black Sabbath manager Don Arden, suggested former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio to replace Ozzy Osbourne in 1979[citation needed]. Don Arden was at this point still trying to convince Osbourne to rejoin the band, as he viewed the original line-up as the most profitable.[19] Dio officially joined in June, and the band began writing their next album. With a notably different vocal style from Osbourne's, Dio's addition to the band marked a change in Black Sabbath's sound. \"They were totally different altogether\", Iommi explains. \"Not only voice-wise, but attitude-wise. Ozzy was a great showman, but when Dio came in, it was a different attitude, a different voice and a different musical approach, as far as vocals. Dio would sing across the riff, whereas Ozzy would follow the riff, like in \"Iron Man\". Ronnie came in and gave us another angle on writing.\"[79]\n\nButler temporarily left the band in September 1979 to deal with the divorce from his first wife. According to Dio, the band initially hired Craig Gruber, with whom Dio had previously played while in Elf and Rainbow, on bass to assist with writing the new album.[80] Gruber was soon replaced by Geoff Nicholls of Quartz. The new line-up returned to Criteria Studios in November to begin recording work, with Butler returning to the band in January 1980 and Nicholls moving to keyboards. Produced by Martin Birch, Heaven and Hell was released on 25 April 1980, to critical acclaim. Over a decade after its release, AllMusic said the album was \"one of Sabbath's finest records, the band sounds reborn and re-energised throughout\".[81] Heaven and Hell peaked at number nine in the United Kingdom and number 28 in the U.S., the band's highest-charting album since Sabotage. The album eventually sold a million copies in the U.S.,[44] and the band embarked on an extensive world tour, making their first live appearance with Dio in Germany on 17 April 1980.\n\nBlack Sabbath toured the U.S. throughout 1980 with Blue \u00d6yster Cult on the \"Black and Blue\" tour, with a show at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, filmed for Don Kirshner's Rock Concert[82] and later released theatrically in 1981 as Black and Blue.[83] On 26 July 1980, the band played to 75,000 fans at a sold-out Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with Journey, Cheap Trick and Molly Hatchet.[84][85] The next day, the band appeared at the 1980 Day on the Green at Oakland Coliseum. While on tour, Black Sabbath's former label in England issued a live album culled from a seven-year-old performance, titled Live at Last without any input from the band. The album reached number five on the UK chart and saw the re-release of \"Paranoid\" as a single, which reached the top 20.[40]\n\nOn 18 August 1980, after a show in Bloomington, Minnesota, Ward quit the band. \"It was intolerable for me to get on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a day, my alcoholism accelerated\". Butler stated that after Ward's final show, the drummer came in drunk, stating that \"he might as well be a Martian\". Ward then got angry, packed his things and got on a bus to leave. Following Ward's sudden departure, the group hired drummer Vinny Appice.[86] Further trouble for the band came during their 9 October 1980 concert at the Milwaukee Arena, which degenerated into a riot that caused $10,000 in damages to the arena and resulted in 160 arrests. According to the Associated Press: \"The crowd of mostly adolescent males first became rowdy in a performance by the Blue Oyster Cult\" and then grew restless while waiting an hour for Black Sabbath to begin playing. A member of the audience threw a beer bottle that struck Butler and effectively ended the show. \"The band then abruptly halted its performance and began leaving\" as the crowd rioted.[87]\n\nThe band completed the Heaven and Hell world tour in February 1981 and returned to the studio to begin work on their next album.[88] Black Sabbath's second studio album that was produced by Martin Birch and featured Ronnie James Dio as vocalist, Mob Rules, was released in October 1981 and was well received by fans, but less so by critics. Rolling Stone reviewer J. D. Considine gave the album one star, claiming \"Mob Rules finds the band as dull-witted and flatulent as ever\".[89] Like most of the band's earlier work, time helped to improve the opinions of the music press. A decade after its release, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called Mob Rules \"a magnificent record\".[90] The album was certified Gold[44] and reached the top 20 on the UK chart. The album's title track, \"The Mob Rules\", which was recorded at John Lennon's old house in England,[88] was also featured in the 1981 animated film Heavy Metal, although the film version is an alternate take and differs from the album version.[88]\n\nUnhappy with the quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band recorded another live album \u2013 titled Live Evil \u2013 during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio and Seattle, in 1982.[91] During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling-out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals.[92] In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork.[93] Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath.[94] \"Ronnie wanted more say in things\", Iommi said. \"And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'\".[95] \"When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do\", Dio later said. \"I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny\".[96]\n\nRonnie James Dio left Black Sabbath in November 1982 to start his own band and took drummer Vinny Appice with him. Live Evil was released in January 1983, but was overshadowed by Ozzy Osbourne's Platinum-selling album Speak of the Devil.[44]\n\nThe remaining original members, Iommi and Butler, began auditioning singers for the band's next release. Deep Purple and Whitesnake's David Coverdale, Samson's Nicky Moore and Lone Star's John Sloman were all considered, and Iommi states in his autobiography that Michael Bolton auditioned,[97][98] though this claim has been disputed, with Butler suggesting that Iommi concocted the story as \"a joke\"[99] and Bolton insisting it was \"only a rumour\".[100] The band settled on former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan to replace Dio in December 1982.[74][101] The project was initially not to be called Black Sabbath, but pressure from the record label forced the group to retain the name.[101] The band entered The Manor Studios in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, in June 1983 with a returned and newly sober Bill Ward on drums.[101] \"That was the very first album that I ever did clean and sober,\" Ward recalled. \"I only got drunk after I finished all my work on the album \u2013 which wasn't a very good idea... Sixty to seventy per cent of my energy was taken up on learning how to get through the day without taking a drink and learning how to do things without drinking, and thirty per cent of me was involved in the album.\"[102]\n\nBorn Again (9 September 1983) was panned on release by critics. Despite this negative reception, it reached number four in the UK, and number 39 in the U.S.[40] Even three decades after its release, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album \"dreadful\", noting that \"Gillan's bluesy style and humorous lyrics were completely incompatible with the lords of doom and gloom\".[103]\n\nUnable to tour because of the pressures of the road, Ward quit the band. \"I fell apart with the idea of touring,\" he later explained. \"I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake.\"[104] He was replaced by former Move and Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again '83\u2013'84 world tour,[101] (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feighn Death Sabbath '83\u2013'84' World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the U.S. with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger. The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival in England, adding Deep Purple's \"Smoke on the Water\" to their encore.[105]\n\nThe tour in support of Born Again included a giant set of the Stonehenge monument. In a move later parodied in the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, the band made a mistake in ordering the set piece. Butler explained:\n\nWe had Sharon Osbourne's dad, Don Arden, managing us. He came up with the idea of having the stage set be Stonehenge. He wrote the dimensions down and gave it to our tour manager. He wrote it down in metres but he meant to write it down in feet. The people who made it saw fifteen metres instead of fifteen feet. It was 45 feet high and it wouldn't fit on any stage anywhere so we just had to leave it in the storage area. It cost a fortune to make but there was not a building on earth that you could fit it into.[106]\nFollowing the completion of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like \"hired help\" by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato and Ward once again rejoined the band. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after.[74] Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, Ward left shortly after stating \"This isn't Black Sabbath\". Butler would quit Sabbath next in November 1984 to form a solo band. \"When Ian Gillan took over that was the end of it for me,\" he said. \"I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it.\"[106]\n\nOne vocalist whose status is disputed, both inside and outside Sabbath, is Christian evangelist and former Joshua frontman Jeff Fenholt. Fenholt insists he was a singer in Sabbath between January and May 1985.[36] Iommi has never confirmed this. Fenholt gives a detailed account in Garry Sharpe-Young's book Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath.[107][page\u00a0needed]\n\nFollowing both Ward's and Butler's exits, sole remaining original member Iommi put Sabbath on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with long-time Sabbath keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. While working on new material, the original Sabbath line-up agreed to a spot at Bob Geldof's Live Aid, performing at the Philadelphia show on 13 July 1985.[36][101] This event \u2013 which also featured reunions of The Who and Led Zeppelin \u2013 marked the first time the original line-up had appeared on stage since 1978.[108] \"We were all drunk when we did Live Aid,\" recalled Geezer Butler, \"but we'd all got drunk separately.\"[109]\n\nReturning to his solo work, Iommi enlisted bassist Dave Spitz (ex-Great White), drummer Eric Singer and initially intended to use multiple singers, including Rob Halford of Judas Priest, former Deep Purple and Trapeze vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio. This plan didn't work as he forecasted.[101] \"We were going to use different vocalists on the album, guest vocalists, but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies. Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album.\"[110]\n\nThe band spent the remainder of the year in the studio, recording what would become Seventh Star (1986). Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath.[111] Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as \"Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi\" in January 1986.[112] \"It opened up a whole can of worms,\" Iommi explained. \"If we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more.\"[113] Seventh Star sounded little like a Sabbath album, incorporating instead elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene. It was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as AllMusic gave album verdicts, calling the album \"often misunderstood and underrated\".[111]\n\nThe new line-up rehearsed for six weeks preparing for a full world tour, although the band were eventually forced to use the Sabbath name. \"I was into the 'Tony Iommi project', but I wasn't into the Black Sabbath moniker,\" Hughes said. \"The idea of being in Black Sabbath didn't appeal to me whatsoever. Glenn Hughes singing in Black Sabbath is like James Brown singing in Metallica. It wasn't gonna work.\"[110][114] Just four days before the start of the tour, Hughes got into a bar fight with the band's production manager John Downing which splintered the singer's orbital bone. The injury interfered with Hughes' ability to sing, and the band brought in vocalist Ray Gillen to continue the tour with W.A.S.P. and Anthrax, although nearly half of the U.S. dates would be cancelled because of poor ticket sales.[115]\n\nBlack Sabbath began work on new material in October 1986 at AIR Studios in Montserrat with producer Jeff Glixman. The recording was fraught with problems from the beginning, as Glixman left after the initial sessions to be replaced by producer Vic Coppersmith-Heaven. Bassist Dave Spitz quit over \"personal issues\", and former Rainbow and Ozzy Osbourne bassist Bob Daisley was brought in. Daisley re-recorded all of the bass tracks, and wrote the album's lyrics, but before the album was complete, he left to join Gary Moore's backing band, taking drummer Eric Singer with him.[74] After problems with second producer Coppersmith-Heaven, the band returned to Morgan Studios in England in January 1987 to work with new producer Chris Tsangarides. While working in the United Kingdom, new vocalist Ray Gillen abruptly left Black Sabbath to form Blue Murder with guitarist John Sykes (ex-Tygers of Pan Tang, Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake) and then Badlands with former Osbourne guitarist Jake E. Lee. The band auditioned a number of singers, including Jon Oliva of Savatage.[116]\n\nThe band enlisted heavy metal vocalist Tony Martin to re-record Gillen's tracks, and former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan to complete a few percussion overdubs.[36] Before the release of the new album Black Sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at Sun City, South Africa during the apartheid era. The band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with Artists United Against Apartheid, who had been boycotting South Africa since 1985.[117] Drummer Bev Bevan refused to play the shows, and was replaced by Terry Chimes, formerly of the Clash,[36] while Dave Spitz returned on bass.\n\nAfter nearly a year in production, The Eternal Idol was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers. On-line internet era reviews were mixed. AllMusic said that \"Martin's powerful voice added new fire\" to the band, and the album contained \"some of Iommi's heaviest riffs in years.\"[118] Blender gave the album two stars, claiming the album was \"Black Sabbath in name only\".[119] The album would stall at No. 66 in the United Kingdom, while peaking at 168 in the U.S.[40] The band toured in support of Eternal Idol in Germany, Italy and for the first time, Greece. In part due to a backlash from promoters over the South Africa incident, other European shows were cancelled.[120] Bassist Dave Spitz left the band again shortly before the tour, and was replaced by Jo Burt, formerly of Virginia Wolf.\n\nFollowing the poor commercial performance of The Eternal Idol, Black Sabbath were dropped by both Vertigo Records and Warner Bros. Records, and signed with I.R.S. Records.[36] The band took time off in 1988, returning in August to begin work on their next album. As a result of the recording troubles with Eternal Idol, Tony Iommi opted to produce the band's next album himself. \"It was a completely new start\", Iommi said. \"I had to rethink the whole thing, and decided that we needed to build up some credibility again\".[121] Iommi enlisted former Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell, long-time keyboardist Nicholls and session bassist Laurence Cottle, and rented a \"very cheap studio in England\".[121]\n\nBlack Sabbath released Headless Cross in April 1989, and it was also ignored by contemporary reviewers, although AllMusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia gave the album four stars and called it \"the finest non-Ozzy or Dio Black Sabbath album\".[122] Anchored by the number 62 charting single \"Headless Cross\", the album reached number 31 on the UK chart, and number 115 in the U.S.[40] Queen guitarist Brian May, a good friend of Iommi's, played a guest solo on the song \"When Death Calls\". Following the album's release the band added touring bassist Neil Murray, formerly of Colosseum II, National Health, Whitesnake, Gary Moore's backing band, and Vow Wow.[74]\n\nThe unsuccessful Headless Cross U.S. tour began in May 1989 with openers Kingdom Come and Silent Rage, but because of poor ticket sales, the tour was cancelled after just eight shows.[36] The European leg of the tour began in September, where the band were enjoying chart success. After a string of Japanese shows the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with Girlschool. Black Sabbath was one of the first bands to tour Russia, after Mikhail Gorbachev opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989.[120]\n\nThe band returned to the studio in February 1990 to record Tyr, the follow-up to Headless Cross. While not technically a concept album, some of the album's lyrical themes are loosely based on Norse mythology.[36] Tyr was released on 6 August 1990, reaching number 24 on the UK albums chart, but was the first Black Sabbath release not to break the Billboard 200 in the U.S.[40] The album would receive mixed internet-era reviews, with AllMusic noting that the band \"mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis\",[123] while Blender gave the album just one star, claiming that \"Iommi continues to besmirch the Sabbath name with this unremarkable collection\".[124] The band toured in support of Tyr with Circus of Power in Europe, but the final seven United Kingdom dates were cancelled because of poor ticket sales.[125] For the first time in their career, the band's touring cycle did not include U.S. dates.[126]\n\nWhile on his Lock Up the Wolves U.S. tour in August 1990, former Sabbath vocalist Ronnie James Dio was joined onstage at the Roy Wilkins Auditorium by Geezer Butler to perform \"Neon Knights\". Following the show, the two expressed interest in rejoining Sabbath. Butler convinced Iommi, who in turn broke up the current line-up, dismissing vocalist Tony Martin and bassist Neil Murray. \"I do regret that in a lot of ways,\" Iommi said. \"We were at a good point then. We decided to [reunite with Dio] and I don't even know why, really. There's the financial aspect, but that wasn't it. I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had.\"[121]\n\nDio and Butler joined Iommi and Cozy Powell in autumn 1990 to begin the next Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell suffered a broken hip when his horse died and fell on the drummer's legs.[127] Unable to complete the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the Mob Rules line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Songs were rewritten multiple times.[128] \"It was just hard work,\" Iommi said. \"We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous.\"[121] Dio recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort: \"It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works. Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album\".[129]\n\nThe resulting Dehumanizer was released on 22 June 1992. In the U.S., the album was released on 30 June 1992 by Reprise Records, as Dio and his namesake band were still under contract to the label at the time. While the album received mixed reviews,[127][130], it was the band's biggest commercial success in a decade.[74] Anchored by the top 40 rock radio single \"TV Crimes\", the album peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200.[40] The album also featured \"Time Machine\", a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film Wayne's World. Additionally, the perception among fans of a return of some semblance of the \"real\" Sabbath provided the band with much needed momentum.\n\nSabbath began touring in support of Dehumanizer in July 1992 with Testament, Danzig, Prong, and Exodus. While on tour, former vocalist Ozzy Osbourne announced his first retirement, and invited Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his No More Tours tour in Costa Mesa, California. The band agreed, aside from Dio, who told Iommi, \"I'm not doing that. I'm not supporting a clown.\"[19] Dio spoke of the situation years later:\n\nI was told in the middle of the tour that we would be opening for Ozzy in Los Angeles. And I said, \"No. Sorry, I have more pride than that.\" A lot of bad things were being said from camp to camp, and it created this horrible schism. So by [the band] agreeing to play the shows in L.A. with Ozzy, that, to me, spelled out reunion. And that obviously meant the doom of that particular project.[129]\nDio quit Sabbath following a show in Oakland, California on 13 November 1992, one night before the band were set to appear at Osbourne's retirement show. Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford stepped in at the last minute, performing two nights with the band.[131] Iommi and Butler joined Osbourne and former drummer Ward on stage for the first time since 1985's Live Aid concert, performing a brief set of Sabbath songs. This set the stage for a longer-term reunion of the original line-up, though that plan proved short-lived. \"Ozzy, Geezer, Tony and Bill announced the reunion of Black Sabbath \u2013 again,\" remarked Dio. \"And I thought that it was a great idea. But I guess Ozzy didn't think it was such a great idea\u2026 I'm never surprised when it comes to whatever happens with them. Never at all. They are very predictable. They don't talk.\"[132]\n\nDrummer Vinny Appice left the band following the reunion show to rejoin Ronnie James Dio's solo band, later appearing on Dio's Strange Highways and Angry Machines. Iommi and Butler enlisted former Rainbow drummer Bobby Rondinelli, and reinstated former vocalist Tony Martin. The band returned to the studio to work on new material, although the project was not originally intended to be released under the Black Sabbath name. As Geezer Butler explains:\n\nIt wasn't even supposed to be a Sabbath album; I wouldn't have even done it under the pretence of Sabbath. That was the time when the original band were talking about getting back together for a reunion tour. Tony and myself just went in with a couple of people, did an album just to have, while the reunion tour was (supposedly) going on. It was like an Iommi/Butler project album.[133]\nUnder pressure from their record label, the band released their seventeenth studio album, Cross Purposes, on 8 February 1994, under the Black Sabbath name. The album received mixed reviews, with Blender giving the album two stars, calling Soundgarden's 1994 album Superunknown \"a far better Sabbath album than this by-the-numbers potboiler\".[134] AllMusic's Bradley Torreano called Cross Purposes \"the first album since Born Again that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record\".[135] The album just missed the Top 40 in the UK reaching number 41, and also reached 122 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S. Cross Purposes contained the song \"Evil Eye\", which was co-written by Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, although uncredited because of record label restrictions.[36] Touring in support of Cross Purposes began in February with Morbid Angel and Mot\u00f6rhead in the U.S. The band filmed a live performance at the Hammersmith Apollo on 13 April 1994, which was released on VHS accompanied by a CD, titled Cross Purposes Live. After the European tour with Cathedral and Godspeed in June 1994, drummer Bobby Rondinelli quit the band and was replaced by original Black Sabbath drummer Ward for five shows in South America.\n\nFollowing the touring cycle for Cross Purposes, bassist Geezer Butler quit the band for the second time. \"I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much preferred the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing\".[133] Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song \"Giving Up the Ghost\", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone[136] (\"I heard it's something about me...\" said Iommi. \"I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really paid any attention to the lyrics... It's nice to see him doing his own thing \u2013 getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend.\"[137]\n\nFollowing Butler's departure, newly returned drummer Ward once again left the band. Iommi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass and Cozy Powell on drums, effectively reuniting the 1990 Tyr line-up. The band enlisted Body Count guitarist Ernie C to produce the new album, which was recorded in London in autumn of 1994. The album featured a guest vocal on \"Illusion of Power\" by Body Count vocalist Ice-T.[138] The resulting Forbidden was released on 8 June 1995, but failed to chart in the U.S.[139][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The album was widely panned by critics; AllMusic's Bradley Torreano said \"with boring songs, awful production, and uninspired performances, this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan\";[140] while Blender magazine called Forbidden \"an embarrassment... the band's worst album\".[141]\n\nBlack Sabbath embarked on a world tour in July 1995 with openers Mot\u00f6rhead and Tiamat, but two months into the tour, drummer Cozy Powell left the band, citing health issues, and was replaced by former drummer Bobby Rondinelli. \"The members I had in the last lineup \u2013 Bobby Rondinelli, Neil Murray \u2013 they're great, great characters...\" Iommi told Sabbath fanzine Southern Cross. \"That, for me, was an ideal lineup. I wasn't sure vocally what we should do, but Neil Murray and Bobby Rondinelli I really got on well with.\"[137]\n\nAfter completing Asian dates in December 1995, Tony Iommi put the band on hiatus, and began work on a solo album with former Black Sabbath vocalist Glenn Hughes, and former Judas Priest drummer Dave Holland. The album was not officially released following its completion, although a widely traded bootleg called Eighth Star surfaced soon after. The album was officially released in 2004 as The 1996 DEP Sessions, with Holland's drums re-recorded by session drummer Jimmy Copley.[142]\n\nIn 1997, Tony Iommi disbanded the current line-up to officially reunite with Ozzy Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath line-up. Vocalist Tony Martin claimed that an original line-up reunion had been in the works since the band's brief reunion at Ozzy Osbourne's 1992 Costa Mesa show, and that the band released subsequent albums to fulfill their record contract with I.R.S. Records. Martin later recalled Forbidden (1995) as a \"filler album that got the band out of the label deal, rid of the singer, and into the reunion. However I wasn't privy to that information at the time\".[143] I.R.S. Records released a compilation album in 1996 to fulfill the band's contract, titled The Sabbath Stones, which featured songs from Born Again (1983) to Forbidden (1995).\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Iommi, Butler and Osbourne reunited to coheadline the Ozzfest tour alongside Osbourne's solo band. The line-up featured Osbourne's drummer Mike Bordin filling in for Ward. \"It started off with me going off to join Ozzy for a couple of numbers,\" explained Iommi, \"and then it got into Sabbath doing a short set, involving Geezer. And then it grew as it went on\u2026 We were concerned in case Bill couldn't make it \u2013 couldn't do it \u2013 because it was a lot of dates, and important dates\u2026 The only rehearsal that we had to do was for the drummer. But I think if Bill had come in, it would have took a lot more time. We would have had to focus a lot more on him.\"[144]\n\nIn December 1997, the group was joined by Ward, marking the first reunion of the original quartet since Osbourne's 1992 \"retirement show\". This line-up recorded two shows at the Birmingham NEC, released as the double album Reunion on 20 October 1998. The album reached number eleven on the Billboard 200,[40] went platinum in the U.S.[44] and spawned the single \"Iron Man\", which won Sabbath their first Grammy Award in 2000 for Best Metal Performance, 30 years after the song was originally released. Reunion featured two new studio tracks, \"Psycho Man\" and \"Selling My Soul\", both of which cracked the top 20 of the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.[40]\n\nShortly before a European tour in the summer of 1998, Ward had a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice.[145] Ward returned for a U.S. tour with openers Pantera, which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer, headlining the annual Ozzfest tour.[74] Following these appearances, the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material. Iommi released his first official solo album, Iommi, in 2000, while Osbourne continued work on Down to Earth (2001).\n\nSabbath returned to the studio to work on new material with all four original members and producer Rick Rubin in the spring of 2001,[74] but the sessions were halted when Osbourne was called away to finish tracks for his solo album in the summer.[146] \"It just came to an end\u2026\" Iommi said. \"It's a shame because [the songs] were really good\".[147] Iommi commented on the difficulty getting all the members together to work:\n\nIt's quite different recording now. We've all done so much in between. In [the early] days there was no mobile phone ringing every five seconds. When we first started, we had nothing. We all worked for the same thing. Now everybody has done so many other things. It's great fun and we all have a good chat, but it's just different, trying to put an album together.[147]\nIn March 2002, Osbourne's Emmy-winning reality show The Osbournes debuted on MTV, and quickly became a worldwide hit.[74] The show introduced Osbourne to a broader audience and to capitalise, the band's back catalogue label, Sanctuary Records released a double live album Past Lives (2002), which featured concert material recorded in the 1970s, including the Live at Last (1980) album. The band remained on hiatus until the summer of 2004 when they returned to headline Ozzfest 2004 and 2005. In November 2005, Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame,[148] and in March 2006, after eleven years of eligibility\u2014Osbourne famously refused the Hall's \"meaningless\" initial nomination in 1999[149]\u2014the band were inducted into the U.S. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[150] At the awards ceremony Metallica played two Sabbath songs, \"Hole in the Sky\" and \"Iron Man\" in tribute.[151]\n\nWhile Ozzy Osbourne was working on new solo album material in 2006, Rhino Records released Black Sabbath: The Dio Years, a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio, and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single \"The Devil Cried\" reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.[40] Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Dio era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi, and Ward was still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same title, to avoid confusion. When asked about the name of the group, Iommi stated \"it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [and] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again.\"[18]\nWard was initially set to participate, but dropped out before the tour began due to musical differences with \"a couple of the band members\".[152] He was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, effectively reuniting the line-up that had featured on the Mob Rules (1981) and Dehumanizer (1992) albums.\n\nHeaven & Hell toured the U.S. with openers Megadeth and Machine Head, and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007, titled Live from Radio City Music Hall. In November 2007, Dio confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album, which was recorded in the following year.[153] In April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the Metal Masters Tour, alongside Judas Priest, Mot\u00f6rhead and Testament.[154] The box set, The Rules of Hell, featuring remastered versions of all the Dio fronted Black Sabbath albums, was supported by the Metal Masters Tour. In 2009, the band announced the title of their debut studio album, The Devil You Know, released on 28 April.[155]\n\nOn 26 May 2009, Osbourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name. Iommi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41-year career and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members.[156]\n\nIn March 2010, Black Sabbath announced that along with Metallica they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate Record Store Day. It was released on 17 April 2010.[157] Ronnie James Dio died on 16 May 2010 from stomach cancer.[158] In June 2010, the legal battle between Ozzy Osbourne and Tony Iommi over the trademarking of the Black Sabbath name ended, but the terms of the settlement have not been disclosed.[159]\n\nIn a January 2010 interview while promoting his biography I Am Ozzy, Osbourne stated that although he would not rule it out, he was doubtful there would be a reunion with all four original members of the band. Osbourne stated: \"I'm not gonna say I've written it out forever, but right now I don't think there's any chance. But who knows what the future holds for me? If it's my destiny, fine.\"[160] In July, Butler said that there would be no reunion in 2011, as Osbourne was already committed to touring with his solo band.[161] However, by that August they had already met up to rehearse together, and continued to do so through the autumn.[162]\n\nOn 11 November 2011, Iommi, Butler, Osbourne, and Ward announced that they were reuniting to record a new album with a full tour in support beginning in 2012.[163] Guitarist Iommi was diagnosed with lymphoma on 9 January 2012, which forced the band to cancel all but two shows (Download Festival, and Lollapalooza Festival) of a previously booked European tour.[164][165] It was later announced that an intimate show would be played in their hometown Birmingham. It was the first concert since the reunion and the only indoors concerts that year.[166] In February 2012, drummer Ward announced that he would not participate further in the band's reunion until he was offered a \"signable contract\".[167]\n\nOn 21 May 2012, at the O2 Academy in Birmingham, Black Sabbath played their first concert since 2005, with Tommy Clufetos playing the drums.[168] In June, they performed at the Download Festival at the Donington Park motorsports circuit in Leicestershire, England, followed by the last concert of the short tour at Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago.[169][170] Later that month, the band started recording an album.[171]\n\nOn 13 January 2013, the band announced that the album would be released in June under the title 13. Brad Wilk (formerly of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave) was chosen as the drummer, and Rick Rubin was chosen as the producer.[172] Mixing of the album commenced in February.[173] On 12 April 2013, the band released the album's track listing. The standard version of the album features eight new tracks, and the deluxe version features three bonus tracks.[174]\n\nThe band's first single from 13, \"God Is Dead?\", was released on 19 April 2013.[175] On 20 April 2013, Black Sabbath commenced their first Australia/New Zealand tour in 40 years followed by a North American Tour in Summer 2013.[176][177] The second single of the album, \"End of the Beginning\", debuted on 15 May in a CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode, where all three members appeared.[178] In June 2013, 13 topped both the UK Albums Chart and the U.S. Billboard 200, becoming their first album to reach number one on the latter chart.[179][180] In 2014, Black Sabbath received their first Grammy Award since 2000 with \"God Is Dead?\" winning Best Metal Performance.[181]\n\nIn July 2013, Black Sabbath embarked on a North American Tour (for the first time since July 2001), followed by a Latin American tour in October 2013. In November 2013, the band started their European tour which lasted until December 2013.[182] In March and April 2014, they made 12 stops in North America (mostly in Canada) as the second leg of their North American Tour before embarking in June 2014 on the second leg of their European tour, which ended with a concert at London's Hyde Park.[183]\n\nOn 29 September 2014, Osbourne told Metal Hammer that Black Sabbath would begin work on their twentieth studio album in early 2015 with producer Rick Rubin, followed by a final tour in 2016.[184][185] In an April 2015 interview, however, Osbourne said that these plans \"could change\", and added, \"We all live in different countries and some of them want to work and some of them don't want to, I believe. But we are going to do another tour together.\"[185]\n\nOn 3 September 2015, it was announced that Black Sabbath would embark on their final tour, titled The End, from January 2016 to February 2017.[186][187] Numerous dates and locations across the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand were announced.[186][188] The final shows of The End tour took place at the Genting Arena in their home city of Birmingham, England on 2 and 4 February 2017.[189][190] On 26 October 2015, it was announced the band consisting of Osbourne, Iommi and Butler would be returning to the Download Festival on 11 June 2016.[191][192] Despite earlier reports that they would enter the studio before their farewell tour, Osbourne stated that there would not be another Black Sabbath studio album.[193] However, an 8-track CD entitled The End was sold at dates on the tour. Along with some live recordings, the CD includes four unused tracks from the 13 sessions.[194]\n\nOn 4 March 2016, Iommi discussed future re-releases of the Tony Martin-era catalogue: \"We've held back on the reissues of those albums because of the current Sabbath thing with Ozzy Osbourne, but they will certainly be happening... I'd like to do a couple of new tracks for those releases with Tony Martin... I'll also be looking at working on Cross Purposes and Forbidden.\"[195] Martin had suggested that this could coincide with the 30th anniversary of The Eternal Idol, in 2017.[196] In an interview that August, Martin added \"[Iommi] still has his cancer issues of course and that may well stop it all from happening but if he wants to do something I am ready.\"[197] On 10 August 2016, Iommi revealed that his cancer was in remission.[198]\n\nAsked in November 2016 about his plans after Black Sabbath's final tour, Iommi replied, \"I'll be doing some writing. Maybe I'll be doing something with the guys, maybe in the studio, but no touring.\"[199] The band played their final concert on 4 February 2017 in Birmingham. The final song was streamed live on the band's Facebook page and fireworks went off as the band took their final bow.[9] The band's final tour was not an easy one, as longstanding tensions between Osbourne and Iommi returned to the surface.[200] Iommi stated that he would not rule out the possibility of one-off shows, \"I wouldn't write that off, if one day that came about. That's possible. Or even doing an album, 'cause then, again, you're in one place. But I don't know if that would happen.\"[201] In an April 2017 interview, Butler revealed that Black Sabbath considered making a blues album as the follow-up to 13, but added that, \"the tour got in the way.\"[202]\n\nOn 7 March 2017, Black Sabbath announced their disbandment through posts made on their official social media accounts.[10][203][204][205]\n\nIn a June 2018 interview with ITV News, Osbourne expressed interest in reuniting with Black Sabbath for a performance at the 2022 Commonwealth Games which would be held in their home city Birmingham.[206] Iommi said that performing at the event as Black Sabbath would be \"a great thing to do to help represent Birmingham. I'm up for it. Let's see what happens.\"[207] He also did not rule out the possibility for the band to reform only for a one-off performance rather than a full-length tour.[208] Iommi was later announced to be part of the opening ceremony for the 2022 Commonwealth Games alongside Duran Duran.[209][210] On 8 August 2022, Osbourne and Iommi made a surprise reunion to end the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games at the Alexander Stadium in Birmingham. They were joined by 2017 Black Sabbath touring musicians Tommy Clufetos and Adam Wakeman for a medley of \"Iron Man\" and \"Paranoid\".[11][211]\n\nIn September 2020, Osbourne stated in an interview that he was no longer interested in a reunion: \"Not for me. It's done. The only thing I do regret is not doing the last farewell show in Birmingham with Bill Ward. I felt really bad about that. It would have been so nice. I don't know what the circumstances behind it were, but it would have been nice. I've talked to Tony a few times, but I don't have any of the slightest interest in doing another gig. Maybe Tony's getting bored now.\"[212][213] Butler also ruled out the possibility of any future Black Sabbath performances in an interview with Eonmusic on 10 November 2020, stating that the band were over: \"There will definitely be no more Sabbath. It's done.\"[214][215] Iommi however, pondered the possibility of another reunion tour in an interview with The Mercury News, stating that he \"would like to play with the guys again\" and that he missed the audiences and stage.[216] Ward stated in an interview with Eddie Trunk that he no longer had the ability or chops to perform with Black Sabbath in concert, but expressed that he would love to make another album with Osbourne, Butler and Iommi.[217][218]\n\nDespite ruling out the possibility of another Black Sabbath reunion, Osbourne revealed in an episode of Ozzy Speaks on Ozzy's Boneyard that he was working with Iommi, who appeared as one of the guests for his thirteenth solo album, Patient Number 9 (2022).[219] In an October 2021 interview with the Metro, Ward revealed that he had kept \"in contact\" with his former bandmates and stated that he was \"very open-minded\" to the possibility of recording another Black Sabbath album: \"I haven't spoken to the guys about it, but I have talked to a couple of people in management about the possibility of making a recording.\"[220]\n\nOn 30 September 2020, Black Sabbath announced a new Dr. Martens shoe collection. The partnership with the British footwear company celebrated the 50th anniversaries of the band's Black Sabbath and Paranoid albums, with the boots depicting artwork from the former.[221] On 13 January 2021, the band announced that they would reissue both Heaven & Hell and Mob Rules as expanded deluxe editions on 5 March 2021, with unreleased material included.[222][223]\n\nIn September 2022, Osbourne reiterated that he was unwilling to continue Black Sabbath, stating that if the band were to make another album, he would not sing on it. However, he remained open to working with Iommi on more solo projects following the latter's involvement on Patient Number 9.[224] Osbourne later retired from touring in February 2023 after not sufficiently recovering from medical treatment, putting the possibility of another Black Sabbath reunion in concert in further doubt.[225] Butler, who had retired in June 2023,[226] insisted that Black Sabbath had been \"put to bed\",[227] until August 2023 when he stated that he was open to performing a one-off show, but expressed that he had \"no desire to tour again\" with Black Sabbath.[228][229] According to Iommi, the band were offered, but turned down, a reunion at Power Trip in October 2023,[230] where Osbourne was initially scheduled to headline the festival's second date; he eventually cancelled his appearance and was replaced by Judas Priest, due to health issues.[231] In May 2024, Osbourne renewed interest in a reunion of the original line-up, admitting he was sad that Ward was not part of the final tour and that \"it wasn't Black Sabbath that finished it. It's unfinished. If they wanted to do one more gig with Bill, I would jump at the chance.\"[232] Iommi, Butler and Ward all later expressed interest in the possibility of a one-off reunion show featuring the original line-up.[233][234][235][236]\n\nThe Birmingham Royal Ballet presented Black Sabbath: The Ballet which premiered at the Birmingham Hippodrome in September 2023, before touring to Theatre Royal, Plymouth and Sadler's Wells Theatre in October.[237]\n\nA box set of Tony Martin-era albums, Anno Domini 1989\u20131995, was released on 31 May 2024 and includes remasters of Headless Cross, Tyr and Cross Purposes and a remixed version of Forbidden; each disc of the box set (except Tyr) includes one bonus track.[238]\n\nBlack Sabbath were a heavy metal band.[239]  The band have also been cited as a key influence on genres including stoner rock,[240] grunge,[241] doom metal,[242] and sludge metal.[243] Early on, Black Sabbath were influenced by Cream, The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix, John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, Blue Cheer, Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, and Iron Butterfly.[244][245][246]\n\nAlthough Black Sabbath went through many line-ups and stylistic changes, their core sound focuses on ominous lyrics and doomy music,[33] often making use of the musical tritone, also called the \"devil's interval\".[32] While their Ozzy-era albums such as Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) had slight compositional similarities to the progressive rock genre that was growing in popularity at the time,[247] standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s, Black Sabbath's dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era.[74] Much like many of their early heavy metal contemporaries, the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio.[248]\n\nAs the band's primary songwriter, Tony Iommi wrote the majority of Black Sabbath's music, while Osbourne would write vocal melodies, and bassist Geezer Butler would write lyrics. The process was sometimes frustrating for Iommi, who often felt pressured to come up with new material: \"If I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything.\"[64] On Iommi's influence, Osbourne later said:\n\nBlack Sabbath never used to write a structured song. There'd be a long intro that would go into a jazz piece, then go all folky... and it worked. Tony Iommi\u2014and I have said this a zillion times\u2014should be up there with the greats. He can pick up a guitar, play a riff, and you say, \"He's gotta be out now, he can't top that.\" Then you come back, and I bet you a billion dollars, he'd come up with a riff that'd knock your fucking socks off.[249] \nBeginning with their third album, Master of Reality (1971), Black Sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars.[74] In 1965, before forming Black Sabbath, guitarist Tony Iommi suffered an accident while working in a sheet metal factory, losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand. Iommi almost gave up music, but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Django Reinhardt, a jazz guitarist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire.[250] Inspired by Reinhardt, Iommi created two thimbles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips. The guitarist began using lighter strings, and detuning his guitar, to better grip the strings with his prosthesis. Early in the band's history Iommi experimented with different dropped tunings, including C\u266f tuning, or 3 semitones down, before settling on E\u266d/D\u266f tuning, or a half-step down from standard tuning.[251]\n\nBlack Sabbath has sold over 70 million records worldwide,[252] including a RIAA-certified 15 million in the U.S.[44] They are one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time. The band helped to create the genre with ground-breaking releases such as Paranoid (1970), an album that Rolling Stone magazine said \"changed music forever\",[253] and called the band \"the Beatles of heavy metal\".[254] Time magazine called Paranoid \"the birthplace of heavy metal\", placing it in their Top 100 Albums of All Time.[255]\n\nMTV placed Black Sabbath at number one on their Top Ten Heavy Metal Bands and VH1 placed them at number two on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.[256][257] VH1 ranked Black Sabbath's \"Iron Man\" the number one song on their 40 Greatest Metal Songs countdown.[258] Rolling Stone magazine ranked the band number 85 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\".[254] AllMusic's William Ruhlmann said:\n\nBlack Sabbath has been so influential in the development of heavy metal rock music as to be a defining force in the style. The group took the blues-rock sound of late '60s acts like Cream, Blue Cheer, and Vanilla Fudge to its logical conclusion, slowing the tempo, accentuating the bass, and emphasising screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies. If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition, Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction, and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later.[74]\nAccording to Rolling Stone's Holly George-Warren, \"Black Sabbath was the heavy metal king of the 1970s.\"[259] Although initially \"despised by rock critics and ignored by radio programmers\", the group sold more than 8 million albums by the end of that decade.[259] \"The heavy metal band\u2026\" marvelled Ronnie James Dio. \"A band that didn't apologise for coming to town; it just stepped on buildings when it came to town.\"[260]\n\nBlack Sabbath have influenced many acts including Judas Priest,[261] Iron Maiden,[262] Diamond Head,[263] Slayer,[20] Metallica,[20] Korn,[20] Black Flag,[264] Mayhem,[20] Venom,[20] Guns N' Roses,[261] Body Count,[265] Alice in Chains,[266] Anthrax,[267] Disturbed,[268] Death,[20] Opeth,[269] Pantera,[20] Megadeth,[270] Sepultura,[271] the Smashing Pumpkins,[272] Slipknot,[273] Foo Fighters,[274] Testament,[275] Fear Factory,[276] Candlemass,[277] Godsmack,[278] Corrosion of Conformity,[279] and Van Halen.[280] Two Gold-selling tribute albums have been released, Nativity in Black Volume 1 & 2, including covers by Sepultura, White Zombie, Type O Negative, Faith No More, Machine Head, Primus, System of a Down, and Monster Magnet.[281]\n\nMetallica's Lars Ulrich, who, along with bandmate James Hetfield inducted Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, said \"Black Sabbath is and always will be synonymous with heavy metal\",[282] while Hetfield said \"Sabbath got me started on all that evil-sounding shit, and it's stuck with me. Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff.\"[283] Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: \"There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style\u2014doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell\u2014it's very distinctive.\"[283] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said \"I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums.\"[283]\n\nLamb of God's Chris Adler said: \"If anybody who plays heavy metal says that they weren't influenced by Black Sabbath's music, then I think that they're lying to you. I think all heavy metal music was, in some way, influenced by what Black Sabbath did.\"[284] Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: \"They were and still are a groundbreaking band...you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath are in the same league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary.\"[285] On Black Sabbath's standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: \"The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. You can hear the despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come.\"[285] Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that \"Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre\".[286]\n\nAccording to Tracii Guns of L.A. Guns and former member of Guns N' Roses, the main riff of \"Paradise City\" by Guns N' Roses, from Appetite for Destruction (1987), was influenced by the song \"Zero the Hero\" from the Born Again album.[287] King Diamond guitarist Andy LaRocque affirmed that the clean guitar part of \"Sleepless Nights\" from Conspiracy (1989) is inspired by Tony Iommi's playing on Never Say Die!.[288]\n\nIn addition to being pioneers of heavy metal, they also have been credited for laying the foundations for heavy metal subgenres stoner rock,[289] sludge metal,[290] thrash metal,[291] black metal and doom metal.[292] Sabbath has had a significant impact on alternative music, being cited as an influence by  Nirvana,[293] Soundgarden,[294] and Dinosaur Jr..[295]\n\nTony Iommi has been credited as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The tips of his fingers were severed in a steel factory,[296] and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.[297]\n\nCulturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film Almost Famous, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.[298]\n\nOriginal line-up\n\nStudio albums\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer", "content": "\n\nSlayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California, formed in 1981 by guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, drummer Dave Lombardo and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the \"big four\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Slayer's final lineup consisted of King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt, who initially joined as a touring member in 2011 before joining the band permanently after Hanneman's death in 2013. Drummer Jon Dette was also a member of the band.\n\nIn the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, torture, genocide, organized crime, secret societies, occultism, terrorism, religion or antireligion, fascism, racism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups. However, its music has been highly influential, being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), has been described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.\n\nSlayer released twelve studio albums, three live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. Slayer sold 5 million copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \"Eyes of the Insane\" and one in 2008 for the song \"Final Six\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Slayer disbanded in 2019 following the conclusion of a year-and-a-half long farewell tour, but has reformed to perform a handful of reunion shows since 2024.\n\nSlayer was formed in 1981 by Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, Dave Lombardo and Tom Araya in Huntington Park, California. The group started out playing covers of songs by bands such as Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom at parties and clubs in Southern California. The band's early image relied heavily on Satanic themes that featured pentagrams, make-up, spikes, and inverted crosses.[1] Rumors that the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 film of the same name, were denied by King, as he later stated: \"We never were; it's a myth to this day.\"[2] According to Lombardo, the original band name was to be Wings of Fire before they settled in with Slayer. It was he who designed the iconic logo. For inspiration, Lombardo thought in a perspective of a murderer of how they would carve out the logo with a knife and since he's lefthanded, the logo is unintentionally slanted to the right.[3]\n\nIn 1983, Slayer was invited to open for the band Bitch at the Woodstock Club in Anaheim, California, to perform eight songs, six of which were covers. The band was spotted by Brian Slagel, a former music journalist who had recently founded Metal Blade Records. Impressed with Slayer, he met with the band backstage and asked them to record an original song for his upcoming Metal Massacre III compilation album. The band agreed and their song \"Aggressive Perfector\" created an underground buzz upon its release in mid 1983, which led to Slagel offering the band a recording contract with Metal Blade.[4]\n\nWithout any recording budget, the band had to self-finance its debut album. Combining the savings of Araya, who was employed as a respiratory therapist,[5] and money borrowed from King's father,[6] the band entered the studio in November 1983. The album was rushed into release, stocking shelves three weeks after tracks were completed. Show No Mercy, released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band. The group began a club tour of California to promote the album. The tour gave the band additional popularity and sales of Show No Mercy eventually reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.[4]\n\nIn February 1984, King briefly joined Dave Mustaine's new band Megadeth.[7] Hanneman was worried about King's decision, stating in an interview, \"I guess we're gonna get a new guitar player.\"[6] While Mustaine wanted King to stay on a permanent basis, King left after five shows, stating Mustaine's band was \"taking too much of my time.\"[6] The split caused a rift between King and Mustaine, which evolved into a long running feud between the two bands.[8]\n\nIn June 1984, Slayer released a three-track EP called Haunting the Chapel. The EP featured a darker, more thrash-oriented style than Show No Mercy, and laid the groundwork for the future direction of the band.[9] The opening track, \"Chemical Warfare\", has become a live staple, played at nearly every show since 1984.[10]\n\nLater that year, Slayer began their first national club tour, traveling in Araya's Camaro towing a U-Haul trailer.[6][11] The band recorded the live album Live Undead in November 1984 while in New York City.\n\nIn March 1985, Slayer began a national tour with Venom and Exodus, resulting in their first live home video dubbed Combat Tour: The Ultimate Revenge. The video featured live footage filmed at the Studio 54 club. The band then made its live European debut at the Heavy Sound Festival in Belgium opening for UFO.[12] Also in 1985, Slayer toured or played selected shows with bands like Megadeth, Destruction, D.R.I., Possessed, Agent Steel, S.O.D., Nasty Savage and Metal Church.[11]\n\nShow No Mercy had sold over 40,000 copies,[4] which led to the band returning to the studio to record their second full-length album. Metal Blade financed a recording budget, which allowed the band to hire producer Ron Fair.[6] Released in April 1985, Slayer's second full-length album, Hell Awaits, expanded on the darkness of Haunting the Chapel, with hell and Satan as common song subjects. The album was the band's most progressive offering, featuring longer and more complex song structures.[6] The intro of the title track is a backwards recording of a demonic-sounding voice repeating \"Join us\", ending with \"Welcome back\" before the track begins. The album was a hit, with fans choosing Slayer for best band, best live band, Hell Awaits, as 1985's best album, and Dave Lombardo as best drummer in Metal Forces' 1985 Readers Poll.[13]\n\nFollowing the success of Hell Awaits, Slayer was offered a recording contract with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin's newly founded Def Jam Records, then-a largely hip hop-based label.[6] The band accepted, and with an experienced producer and major label recording budget, the band underwent a sonic makeover for their third album Reign in Blood, resulting in shorter, faster songs with clearer production. The complex arrangements and long songs featured on Hell Awaits were ditched in favor of stripped down, hardcore punk influenced song structures.[6]\n\nDef Jam's distributor, Columbia Records, refused to release the album due to the song \"Angel of Death\"[6] which detailed Holocaust concentration camps and the human experiments conducted by Nazi physician Josef Mengele. The album was distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records' release schedule.[6] Although the album received virtually no radio airplay, it became the band's first to enter the Billboard 200, peaking at number 94,[14] and the band's first album certified gold in the United States.[15]\n\nSlayer embarked on the Reign in Pain world tour, with Overkill in the US from October to December 1986, and Malice in Europe in April and May 1987. They also played with other bands such as Agnostic Front, Testament, Metal Church, D.R.I., Dark Angel and Flotsam and Jetsam.[11][16] The band was added as the opening act on W.A.S.P.'s US tour, but just one month into it, drummer Lombardo left the band: \"I wasn't making any money. I figured if we were gonna be doing this professionally, on a major label, I wanted my rent and utilities paid.\"[6] To continue with the tour, Slayer enlisted Tony Scaglione of Whiplash. However, Lombardo was convinced by his wife to return in 1987.[6] At the insistence of Rubin, Slayer recorded a cover version of Iron Butterfly's \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" for the film Less than Zero.[6] Although the band was not happy with the final product, Hanneman deeming it \"a poor representation of Slayer\" and King labeling it \"a hunk of shit\", it was one of their first songs to garner radio airplay.[6]\n\nIn late 1987, Slayer returned to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided to slow down the tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, \"We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird\u2014we've never done that on an album, before or since.\"[6]\n\nReleased in July 1988, South of Heaven received mixed responses from both fans and critics, although it was Slayer's most commercially successful release at the time, debuting at number 57 on the Billboard 200,[14] and their second album to receive gold certification in the United States.[15] Press response to the album was mixed, with AllMusic citing the album as \"disturbing and powerful\",[17] and Kim Neely of Rolling Stone calling it \"genuinely offensive satanic drivel\".[18] King said \"that album was my most lackluster performance\", although Araya called it a \"late bloomer\" which eventually grew on people.[6] Slayer toured from August 1988 to January 1989 to promote South of Heaven, supporting Judas Priest in the US on their Ram It Down tour, and touring Europe with Nuclear Assault and the US with Mot\u00f6rhead and Overkill.[11]\n\nSlayer returned to the studio in early 1990 with co-producer Andy Wallace to record its fifth studio album. Following the backlash created by South of Heaven, Slayer returned to the \"pounding speed of Reign in Blood, while retaining their newfound melodic sense.\"[19] Seasons in the Abyss, released on October 9, 1990, was the first Slayer album to be released under Rubin's new Def American label, as he had parted ways with Def Jam owner Russell Simmons over creative differences. The album debuted at number 44 on the Billboard 200,[14] and was certified gold in 1992.[15] The album spawned Slayer's first music video for the album's title track, which was filmed in front of the Giza pyramids in Egypt.[20]\n\nSlayer returned as a live act in September 1990 to co-headline the European Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Suicidal Tendencies, and Testament. During the sold out European leg of this tour, tickets had prices skyrocket to 1,000 Deutschmark (US$680) on the black market. With the popularity of American thrash at its peak, the band toured with Testament again in early 1991 and triple-headlined the North American version of the Clash of the Titans tour that summer with Megadeth, Anthrax, and opening act Alice in Chains.[11] The band released a double live album, Decade of Aggression in 1991, to celebrate ten years since their formation. The compilation debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200.[14]\n\nIn May 1992, Lombardo left the band due to conflicts with the other members, as well as his desire to be off tour for the birth of his first child.[21] Lombardo formed his own band Grip Inc., with Voodoocult guitarist Waldemar Sorychta,[22] and Slayer recruited former Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph to fill in the drummer position. Slayer made its debut appearance with Bostaph at the 1992 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington. Bostaph's first studio effort was a medley of three Exploited songs, \"War\", \"UK '82\", and \"Disorder\", with rapper Ice-T, for the Judgment Night movie soundtrack in 1993.[23]\n\nOn September 27, 1994, Slayer released Divine Intervention, the band's first album with Bostaph on the drums. The album featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of the Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils of church, and the lengths to which governments went to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much of the content of the lyrics.[5][24]\n\nSlayer geared up for a world tour in 1995, with openers Biohazard and Machine Head. A video of concert footage, Live Intrusion was released, featuring a joint cover of Venom's \"Witching Hour\" with Machine Head. Following the tour, Slayer was billed third at the 1995 Monsters of Rock festival, headlined by Metallica. In 1996, Undisputed Attitude, an album of punk covers, was released. The band covered songs by Minor Threat, T.S.O.L., Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, D.I., Verbal Abuse, Dr. Know, and The Stooges. The album featured three original tracks, \"Gemini\", \"Can't Stand You\", \"Ddamm\"; the latter two were written by Hanneman in 1984\u20131985 for a side project entitled Pap Smear. Bostaph left Slayer shortly after the album's recording to work on his own project, Truth About Seafood. With Bostaph's departure, Slayer recruited Testament drummer Jon Dette, and headlined the 1996 Ozzfest alongside Ozzy Osbourne, Danzig, Biohazard, Sepultura, and Fear Factory. Dette was fired after a year, due to a fallout with band members. After that, Bostaph returned to continue the tour.[25]\n\nDiabolus in Musica (Latin for \"The Devil in Music\") was released in 1998, and debuted at number 31 on the Billboard 200, selling over 46,000 copies in its first week.[26] It was complete by September 1997, and scheduled to be released the following month, but got delayed by nine months after their label was taken over by Columbia Records.[27] The album received a mixed critical reception, and was criticized for adopting characteristics of nu metal music such as tuned down guitars, murky chord structures, and churning beats. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin described the album as \"a feeble attempt at incorporating updated elements into the group's sound, the presence of which elevated the band's efforts somewhat and offered hope that Slayer could refrain from endlessly rehashing their previous material for their future output\",[28] while Ben Ratliff of The New York Times had similar sentiments, writing on June 22, 1998, that: \"Eight of the 11 songs on Diabolus in Musica, a few of which were played at the show, are in the same gray key, and the band's rhythmic ideas have a wearying sameness too.\"[29]\n\nThe album was the band's first to primarily feature dropped tuning, making use of the tritone interval referred to in the Middle Ages as the Devil's interval.[30] Slayer teamed up with digital hardcore group Atari Teenage Riot to record a song for the Spawn soundtrack titled \"No Remorse (I Wanna Die)\". The band paid tribute to Black Sabbath by recording a cover of \"Hand of Doom\" for the second of two tribute albums, titled Nativity in Black II. A world tour followed to support the new album, with Slayer making an appearance at the United Kingdom Ozzfest 1998.\n\nDuring mid-2001, the band joined Morbid Angel, Pantera, Skrape and Static-X on the Extreme Steel Tour of North America, which was Pantera's last major tour.[31][32] After delays regarding remixing and artwork, including slip covers created to cover the original artwork as it was deemed \"too graphic\", Slayer's next album, God Hates Us All, was released on September 11, 2001. The band received its first Grammy nomination for the lead track \"Disciple\", although the Grammy was awarded to Tool, for \"Schism\".[33] The September 11 attacks on America jeopardized the 2001 European tour Tattoo the Planet originally set to feature Pantera, Static-X, Cradle of Filth, Biohazard and Vision of Disorder. The dates in the United Kingdom were postponed due to flight restrictions, with a majority of bands deciding to withdraw, leaving Slayer and Cradle of Filth remaining for the European leg of the tour.[34]\n\nPantera, Static-X, Vision of Disorder and Biohazard were replaced by other bands depending on location; Amorphis, In Flames, Moonspell, Children of Bodom, and Necrodeath. Biohazard eventually decided to rejoin the tour later on, and booked new gigs in the countries, where they missed a few dates. Drummer Bostaph left Slayer before Christmas in 2001, due to a chronic elbow injury, which would hinder his ability to play.[35] Since the band's European tour was unfinished at that time, the band's manager, Rick Sales, contacted original drummer Dave Lombardo and asked if he would like to finish the remainder of the tour.[36] Lombardo accepted the offer, and stayed as a permanent member.[35]\n\nSlayer toured playing Reign in Blood in its entirety throughout the fall of 2003, under the tour banner \"Still Reigning\". Their playing of the final song, \"Raining Blood\", culminated with the band drenched in a rain of stage blood. Live footage of this was recorded at the Augusta Civic Center in Augusta, Maine, on July 11, 2004, and released on the 2004 DVD Still Reigning. The band also released War at the Warfield and a box set, Soundtrack to the Apocalypse featuring rarities, live CD and DVD performances and various Slayer merchandise. From 2002 to 2004, the band performed over 250 tour dates, headlining major music festivals including H82k2, Summer tour, Ozzfest 2004 and a European tour with Slipknot. While preparing for the Download Festival in England, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich was taken to a hospital with an unknown and mysterious illness, and was unable to perform. Metallica vocalist James Hetfield searched for volunteers at the last minute to replace Ulrich; Lombardo and Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison volunteered, with Lombardo performing the songs \"Battery\" and \"The Four Horsemen\".[37]\n\nThe next studio album, Christ Illusion, was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, and would be the first album with original drummer Lombardo since 1990's Seasons in the Abyss.[38] However, the band decided to delay the release of the record, as they did not want to be among the many, according to King, \"half-ass, stupid fucking loser bands\" releasing records on June 6,[39] although USA Today reported the idea was thwarted because the band failed to secure sufficient studio recording time.[40] Slayer released Eternal Pyre on June 6 as a limited-edition EP. Eternal Pyre featured the song \"Cult\", a live performance of \"War Ensemble\" in Germany and video footage of the band recording \"Cult\". Five thousand copies were released and sold exclusively through Hot Topic chain stores, and sold out within hours of release.[41] On June 30, Nuclear Blast Records released a 7\" vinyl picture disc version limited to a thousand copies.[42]\n\nChrist Illusion was eventually released on August 8, 2006, and debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200, selling over 62,000 copies in its first week.[43] The album became Slayer's highest charting, improving on its previous highest charting album, Divine Intervention, which had debuted at number 8. However, despite its high positioning, the album dropped to number 44 in the following week.[44] Three weeks after the album's release, Slayer were inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame for their influence to the heavy metal scene.[45]\n\nA worldwide tour dubbed The Unholy Alliance Tour, was undertaken to support the new record. The tour was originally set to launch on June 6 in San Diego, but was postponed to June 10, as Araya had to undergo gall bladder surgery.[46] In Flames, Mastodon, Children of Bodom, Lamb of God, and Thine Eyes Bleed (featuring Araya's brother, Johnny) and Ted Maul (London Hammersmith Apollo) were supporting Slayer.[47] The tour made its way through America and Europe and the bands who participated, apart from Thine Eyes Bleed, reunited to perform at Japan's Loudpark Festival on October 15, 2006.[48]\n\nThe video for the album's first single, \"Eyes of the Insane\", was released on October 30, 2006.[49] The track was featured on the Saw III soundtrack, and won a Grammy-award for \"Best Metal Performance\" at the 49th Grammy Awards, although the band was unable to attend due to touring obligations.[50] A week later, the band visited the 52nd Services Squadron located on the Spangdahlem U.S. Air Force Base in Germany to meet and play a show. This was the first visit ever to a military base for the band.[51] The band made its first network TV appearance on the show Jimmy Kimmel Live! on January 19, playing the song \"Eyes of the Insane\", and four additional songs for fans after the show (although footage from \"Jihad\" was cut due to its controversial lyrical themes).[52]\n\nIn 2007, Slayer toured Australia and New Zealand in April with Mastodon, and appeared at the Download Festival, Rock Am Ring,[53] and a summer tour with Marilyn Manson and Bleeding Through.[54]\n\nIn 2008, Araya stated uncertainty about the future of the band,[55] and that he could not see himself continuing the career at a later age. He said that once the band finished its upcoming album, which was the final record in their contract, the band would sit down and discuss its future.[56] King was optimistic that the band would produce at least another two albums before considering to disband: \"We're talking of going in the studio next February [2009] and getting the next record out so if we do things in a timely manner I don't see there's any reason why we can't have more than one album out.\"[57] Slayer, along with Trivium, Mastodon, and Amon Amarth, teamed up for a European tour titled 'The Unholy Alliance: Chapter III', throughout October and November 2008.[58][59] Slayer headlined the second Mayhem Festival in the summer of 2009. Slayer, along with Megadeth, also co-headlined Canadian Carnage, the first time they performed together in more than 15 years when they co-headlined four shows in Canada in late June 2009 with openers Machine Head and Suicide Silence.[60]\n\nThe band's eleventh studio album, World Painted Blood, was released by American Recordings. It was available on November 3 in North America and November 2 for the rest of the world. The band stated that the album takes elements of all their previous works including Seasons in the Abyss, South of Heaven, and Reign in Blood.[61] Slayer, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010, at Bemowo Airport, in Warsaw, Poland. One of the following Big 4 performances in (Sofia, Bulgaria, June 22, 2010) was sent via satellite in HD to cinemas.[62] They also went on to play several other dates as part of the Sonisphere Festival. Megadeth and Slayer joined forces once again for the American Carnage Tour from July to October 2010 with opening acts Anthrax and Testament,[63][64] and European Carnage Tour in March and April 2011.[65] The \"Big Four\" played more dates at Sonisphere in England and France for the first time ever.[66] Slayer returned to Australia in February and March 2011 as part of the Soundwave Festival and also played in California with the other members of the \"Big Four\".\n\nIn early 2011, Hanneman was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. According to the band, doctors said that it likely originated from a spider bite. Araya said of Hanneman's condition: \"Jeff was seriously ill. Jeff ended up contracting a bacteria that ate away his flesh on his arm, so they cut open his arm, from his wrist to his shoulder, and they did a skin graft on him, they cleaned up ... It was a flesh-eating virus, so he was really, really bad. So we'll wait for him to get better, and when he's a hundred percent, he's gonna come out and join us.\"[67] The band decided to play their upcoming tour dates without Hanneman.[68] Gary Holt of Exodus was announced as Hanneman's temporary replacement.[69] Cannibal Corpse guitarist Pat O'Brien filled in for Holt during a tour in Europe.[70] On April 23, 2011, at the American Big 4 show in Indio, California, Hanneman rejoined his bandmates to play the final two songs of their set, \"South of Heaven\" and \"Angel of Death\". This turned out to be Hanneman's final live performance with the band.[71]\n\nWhen asked if Slayer would make another album, Lombardo replied \"Yes absolutely; Although there's nothing written, there are definitely plans.\"[72] However, Araya said Slayer would not begin writing a new album until Hanneman's condition improved.[73] To celebrate the 25th anniversary of Reign In Blood, the band performed all of the album's tracks at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival at the Alexandra Palace in London.[74][75][76]\n\nIn November 2011, Lombardo posted a tweet that the band had started to write new music. This presumably meant that Hanneman's condition improved, and it was believed he was ready to enter the studio.[77] King had worked with Lombardo that year and they completed three songs. The band planned on entering the studio in either March or April 2012 and were hoping to have the album recorded before the group's US tour in late May and release it by the summer of that year.[78] However, King said the upcoming album would not be finished until September and October of that year, making a 2013 release likely.[79] In July 2012, King revealed two song titles for the upcoming album, \"Chasing Death\" and \"Implode\".[80]\n\nIn February 2013, Lombardo was fired right before Slayer was to play at Australia's Soundwave festival due to an argument with band members over a pay dispute.[81] Slayer and American Recordings released a statement, saying \"Mr. Lombardo came to the band less than a week before their scheduled departure for Australia to present an entirely new set of terms for his engagement that were contrary to those that had been previously agreed upon\",[82] although Lombardo claimed there was a gag order in place.[81] Dette returned to fill in for Lombardo for the Soundwave dates.[83] It was confirmed that Lombardo was officially out of Slayer for the third time, and, in May, Bostaph rejoined the band.[84]\n\nKing said in February 2024 that he had severed ties with Lombardo ever since, adding that \"he's dead to me.\"[85]\n\nOn May 2, 2013, Hanneman died due to liver failure in a local hospital near his home in Southern California's Inland Empire;[86][87] the cause of death was later determined to be alcohol-related cirrhosis.[88] King confirmed that the band would continue, saying \"Jeff is going to be in everybody's thoughts for a long time. It's unfortunate you can't keep unfortunate things from happening. But we're going to carry on \u2013 and he'll be there in spirit.\"[89] However, Araya felt more uncertain about the band's future, expressing his belief that \"After 30 years [with Hanneman active in the band], it would literally be like starting over\", and doubting that Slayer's fanbase would approve such a change.[90] Despite the uncertainty regarding the band's future, Slayer still worked on a followup to World Painted Blood. Additionally, it was reported that the new album would still feature material written by Hanneman.[91]\n\nAt the 2014 Revolver's Golden Gods Awards ceremony, Slayer debuted \"Implode\", its first new song in five years. The group announced that they had signed with Nuclear Blast, and planned to release a new album in 2015.[92] It was reported that Holt would take over Hanneman's guitar duties full-time,[93] although Holt did not participate in the songwriting.[94] In February, Slayer announced a seventeen-date American tour to start in June featuring Suicidal Tendencies and Exodus.[95] In 2015, Slayer headlined the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival for the second time.[96] Repentless, the band's twelfth studio album, was released on September 11, 2015.[97] Slayer toured for 2+1\u20442 years in support of Repentless. The band toured Europe with Anthrax and Kvelertak in October and November 2015,[98] and embarked on three North American tours: one with Testament and Carcass in February and March 2016,[99] then with Anthrax and Death Angel in September and October 2016,[100] and with Lamb of God and Behemoth in July and August 2017.[101] A lone date in Southeast Asia in 2017 was held in the Philippines.[102]\n\nIn August 2016, guitarist Kerry King was asked if Slayer would release a follow-up to Repentless. He replied, \"We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are way ahead of the ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet.\" King also stated that Slayer was not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018.[103] In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he was \"completely open\" to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, \"I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open.\"[104]\n\nIn a June 2017 interview with the Ultimate Guitar Archive, Holt said that he was ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album.[105] When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, \"Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded\u2014some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it.\" He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, \"I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every time I do, I make a liar of myself! [Laughs]\"[106] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, \"It depends on touring\u2014getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time.\"[107] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, \"When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'\"[108]\n\nPlans for a new album were ultimately scrapped when on January 22, 2018, Slayer announced their farewell world tour through a video featuring a montage of press clippings, early posters and press photos spanning the band's entire career. Although the members of Slayer have never publicly explained why they were retiring, it was thought that one of the reasons behind this decision was Tom Araya's desire not to tour anymore and to spend more time with his family; Araya hinted at the possibility of retiring in a 2016 interview.[109] This was confirmed by former drummer Dave Lombardo in a 2019 interview, who said: \"Apparently, from what I hear. Tom has been wanting to retire when I was in the band\u2014he wanted to stop. He had the neck issues. He's been wanting to retire for a long time now. So now that he's got it, I'm happy for him, and I hope he gets what he wants out of life and his future.\"[110]\n\nThe farewell tour began with a North American trek in May and June 2018, supported by Lamb of God, Anthrax, Behemoth and Testament.[111] The second leg of the North American tour took place in July and August, with Napalm Death replacing Behemoth,[112] followed in November and December by a European tour with Lamb of God, Anthrax and Obituary.[113][114] The farewell tour continued into 2019, with plans to visit places such as South America, Australia and Japan; in addition to European festivals such as Hellfest and Graspop,[115][116] the band toured the United States in May 2019 with Lamb of God, Amon Amarth and Cannibal Corpse.[117] Slayer also played one show in Mexico at Force Fest in October 2018.[118][119]\n\nOn December 2, 2018, Holt announced that he would not perform the remainder of the band's European tour to be with his dying father. Vio-lence and former Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel would fill in for him as a result.[120][121][122]\n\nHolt had stated that Slayer would not release a new album before the end of the farewell tour.[123] On how long the tour would last, Holt's Exodus bandmate Steve \"Zetro\" Souza commented, \"I'm speculating it's gonna take a year and a half or two years to do the one final thing, but I believe it's finished. Everybody knows what I know; just because I'm on the outside, I have no insight on that.\"[124] The final North American leg of the tour, dubbed \"The Last Campaign\", took place in November 2019, and also included support from Primus, Ministry and Philip H. Anselmo & The Illegals.[125] Despite being referred to as a farewell tour for Slayer, their manager Rick Sales has stated that \"the band is not breaking up, they made a decision to stop touring. That doesn't mean the end of the band. It\u2019s just the end of touring\".[126] Kristen Mulderig, who works with Rick Sales Entertainment Group, has also been quoted as saying that there would be Slayer-related activities following the tour's conclusion.[127] However, within two days after the tour's completion, King's wife Ayesha stated on her Instagram page that there is \"not a chance in hell\" that Slayer would ever reunite to perform more shows or release new music.[128]\n\nIn March 2020, when talking to Guitar World about his latest endorsement with Dean Guitars, King hinted that he would continue to make music outside of Slayer, simply saying, \"Dean didn't sign me for nothing!\"[129] King stated in an August 2020 interview on the Dean Guitars YouTube channel that he had \"more than two records' worth of music\" for his yet-to-be disclosed new project.[130] Bostaph later confirmed that he and King were working on a new project that would \"sound like Slayer without it being Slayer\u2014but not intentionally so.\"[131] This project was later revealed to be King's solo debut album, From Hell I Rise, released on May 17, 2024, and the lineup of the album includes King, Bostaph, Death Angel vocalist Mark Osegueda, Hellyeah bassist Kyle Sanders, and former Vio-lence and Machine Head guitarist Phil Demmel.[132][133][134]\n\nIn addition to King and Bostaph, the other members of Slayer have remained musically active. Holt continues to record and perform with Exodus, releasing a new album, Persona Non Grata, in 2021.[135] Lombardo has been involved with various acts since his third split with Slayer in 2013, such as Suicidal Tendencies, Dead Cross, the Misfits, Mr. Bungle and Testament, the latter of where he had previously served as the drummer for the band's 1999 album The Gathering and rejoined in March 2022,[136][137] only to leave again in the following April.[138][139] Jon Dette has been a member of at least two bands, Animetal USA and Meshiaak,[140][141] and performed with Anthrax and Volbeat as a fill-in drummer.[142][143] Araya, aside from an appearance in the Bay Area thrash metal documentary film Murder in the Front Row, had not been publicly active in the music industry nor given any interviews between the conclusion of Slayer's final tour and the band's 2024 reunion.\n\nThe members of Slayer had expressed mixed opinions about a reunion. When asked by the Let There Be Talk podcast in June 2020 about the possibility of the band ever reforming, Holt stated, \"If it does, if it ever happens, it has nothing to do with me. Someone else would call and say, 'We wanna [do this].' To my knowledge, it's done. And I think it should be that way. The band went out fucking on a bang, went out on Slayer's terms, and how many people get to say they did that?\".[144] Holt stated in March 2021 that he was open to a potential Slayer reunion, but it was unlikely to happen in the near future: \"Look, if the powers that be ever\u2014like, in a year or something\u2014said, 'Hey, you know what? We feel like playing some shows,' I'm there to do it. But those aren't decisions for me to make, or even me to really speculate on. As far as my knowledge, the band is over, and the final show was November 30, 2019. And I'm full speed ahead with Exodus now.\"[145] In October 2021, King expressed regret that Slayer had retired \"too early.\" While congratulating Machine Head on their 30th anniversary as a band, he said, \"Apparently, it's 30 years, which is quite an achievement. Not a lot of bands get there. We did, and then we quit too early. Fuck us. Fuck me. I hate fucking not playing.\"[146] When interviewed two months later by Metal Hammer, King did not rule out the possibility of any more \"Big Four\" shows with Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax, but expressed doubt that a Slayer reunion would ever happen: \"The way that I'm moving forward is I don't think Slayer are ever going to play again. There's no business of me playing by myself!\"[147] King's wife Ayesha had also ruled out the possibility of a Slayer reunion, insisting that her husband and Araya would \"never be Slayer again\".[148] In a February 2024 interview with Rolling Stone, King clarified that a reunion of the band was unlikely: \"Could Slayer play a show again? I'm sure there's a scenario. Am I looking for it? No, I'm just getting ready to start my career. So if that happens, it happens. But I'm going to be doing this [solo band] for the next 10 years at least.\" King revealed in the same interview that he has not spoken to Araya since the band's split. King also says that his relationship with Araya is positive, but his relation with that of former drummer Dave Lombardo is estranged. Talking about that situation, King said that Lombardo \"was listening to this woman that was his attorney at the time, and she thought we had Metallica money, which we've never had fucking Metallica money. So she's just blowing shit in his ear, and he thinks he should be getting more than he should be getting.\"[85]\n\nOn February 21, 2024, Slayer announced that they would play their first show since disbanding at Riot Fest on September 22, and play their second show five days later at Louder Than Life.[149] However, due to weather conditions caused by Hurricane Helene, Louder Than Life canceled their September 27 shows, which included Slayer in the lineup.[150] The lineup of this reunion was the 2013\u20132019 lineup of bassist/vocalist Tom Araya, guitarists Kerry King and Gary Holt and drummer Paul Bostaph.[151] They also headlined the first of four nights of the Aftershock Festival in Sacramento on October 10, 2024,[152] and while announcing this show, the band said in a statement, \"There's been a lot of excited fans out there about our playing a couple of festival dates, so it's great to be able to add this last one.\"[153]\n\nIn an interview with Metal Hammer, King indicated that the planned shows were a one-off and that the reunion was \"not going to translate into recording and it's not going to translate into touring\", clarifying that \"it's three shows marking five years since our final shows, a fun, 'Hey, remember us from before the pandemic?' celebration.\"[154] In a May 2024 interview on Trunk Nation With Eddie Trunk, King said that while he would not rule out more Slayer shows in the future, his solo career is his main priority now.[155] When asked in an October 2024 interview with 107.7 The Bone if more reunion shows were in the works, Bostaph said, \"We played our last one\u2026 If everybody's asking that question, I am too, but I don't have the answer to that question. So, yeah, Aftershock was the last one. And we all hope that there will be more.\"[156] In October 2024, it was announced that the band would be playing at the 2025 edition of Louder Than Life.[157]\n\nSlayer is generally considered a thrash metal band.[158][159][1][160] In an article from December 1986 by the Washington Post, writer Joe Brown described Slayer as speed metal, a genre he defined as \"an unholy hybrid of punk rock thrash and heavy metal that attracts an almost all-male teen-age following\".[161] Describing Slayer's music, Brown wrote: \"Over a jackhammer beat, Slayer's stun guitars created scraping sheets of corrosive metal noise, with occasional solos that sounded like squealing brakes, over which the singer-bassist emitted a larynx-lacerating growl-yowl.\"[161] In an article from September 1988 by the New York Times, writer Jon Pareles also described Slayer as speed metal, additionally writing that the band \"brings the sensational imagery of tabloids and horror movies\" and has lyrics that \"revel in death, gore and allusions to Satanism and Nazism.\"[162] Pareles also described other \"Big Four\" thrash metal bands Metallica and Megadeth as speed metal bands.[162] Slayer's early works were praised for their \"breakneck speed and instrumental prowess\", combining the structure of hardcore punk tempos and speed metal. The band released fast, aggressive material.[1] The album Reign in Blood is the band's fastest, performed at an average of 220 beats per minute; the album Diabolus in Musica was the band's first to feature C\u266f tuning; God Hates Us All was the first to feature drop B tuning and seven-string guitars tuned to B\u266d.[citation needed] AllMusic cited the album as \"abandoning the extravagances and accessibility of their late-'80s/early-'90s work and returning to perfect the raw approach\",[163] with some fans labeling it as nu metal.[164]\n\nKing and Hanneman's dual guitar solos have been referred to as \"wildly chaotic\",[1] and \"twisted genius\".[165] Original drummer Lombardo would use two bass drums (instead of a double pedal, which is used on a single bass drum). Lombardo's speed and aggression earned him the title of the \"godfather of double bass\" by Drummerworld.[166] Lombardo stated his reasons for using two bass drums: \"When you hit the bass drum, the head is still resonating. When you hit it in the same place right after that, you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe.\" When playing the two bass drums, Lombardo would use the \"heel-up\" technique.[167]\n\nIn the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and King and Hanneman wrote the music with additional arrangement from Lombardo, and sometimes Araya. Araya formed a lyric writing partnership with Hanneman, which sometimes overshadowed the creative input of King.[6] Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music was a \"free-for-all\": \"It's all just whoever comes up with what. Sometimes I'll be more on a roll and I'll have more stuff, same with Kerry \u2013 it's whoever's hot, really. Anybody can write anything; if it's good, we use it; if not, we don't.\"[168]\n\nWhen writing material, the band would write the music first before incorporating lyrics. King or Hanneman used a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff that they created, and to get their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo would mention if any alterations could be made. The band played the riff to get the basic song structure, and figured out where the lyrics and solos would be placed.[168]\n\nSlayer is one of the most influential bands in heavy metal history. Steve Huey of AllMusic believes the musical style of Slayer makes the band stronger than the other members of the \"Big Four\" thrash metal bands Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax, all of which rose to fame during the 1980s.[1][169] Slayer's \"downtuned rhythms, infectious guitar licks, graphically violent lyrics and grisly artwork set the standard for dozens of emerging thrash bands\" and their \"music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal\" states MTV, ranking Slayer as the sixth \"greatest metal band of all time\",[170] ranking number 50 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.[171] Hanneman and King ranked number 10 in Guitar World's \"100 greatest metal guitarists of all time\" in 2004,[172] and were voted \"Best Guitarist/Guitar Team\" in Revolver's reader's poll. Original drummer Lombardo was also voted \"Best Drummer\" and the band entered the top five in the categories \"Best Band Ever\", \"Best Live Band\", \"Album of the Year\" (for Christ Illusion) and \"Band of the Year\".[173]\n\nMusic author Joel McIver considers Slayer very influential in the extreme metal scene, especially in the development of the death metal and black metal subgenres.[174] According to John Consterdine of Terrorizer, without \"Slayer's influence, extreme metal as we know it wouldn't exist.\"[175] Kam Lee of Massacre and former member of Death stated: \"there wouldn't be death metal or black metal or even extreme metal (the likes of what it is today) if not for Slayer.\"[176] Johan Reinholdz of Andromeda said that Slayer \"were crucial in the development of thrash metal which then became the foundation for a lot of different subgenres. They inspired generations of metal bands.\"[176] Alex Skolnick of Testament declared: \"Before Slayer, metal had never had such razor-sharp articulation, tightness, and balance between sound and stops. This all-out sonic assault was about the shock, the screams, the drums, and [...] most importantly the riffs.\"[177]\n\nGroups who cited Slayer among their major influences include Cannibal Corpse,[174] Pantera,[178] Kreator,[179] Sepultura,[180] Children of Bodom,[181] Mayhem,[182] Darkthrone,[174] Avenged Sevenfold,[183] Bullet for My Valentine,[184] Trivium,[185] As I Lay Dying,[186] All That Remains,[187] System of a Down,[188] Killswitch Engage,[189] Slipknot,[190] Machine Head,[191] DevilDriver,[192] Lamb of God,[193] Gojira,[194] Behemoth,[195] Evile[196] and Lacuna Coil.[197] Steve Asheim, drummer for Deicide, declared that \"there obviously would not have been a Deicide as we know it without the existence of Slayer.\"[174] Sepultura guitarist Andreas Kisser affirmed that \"without Slayer, Sepultura would never be possible.\"[198] Weezer mentions them in the song \"Heart Songs\" from their 2008 self-titled \"Red\" album. The verse goes: \"Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Slayer taught me how to shred...\" Dave Grohl recalled, \"Me and my friends, we just wanted to listen to fucking Slayer and take acid and smash stuff.\"[199]\n\nThe band's 1986 release Reign in Blood has been an influence to extreme and thrash metal bands since its release and is considered the record which set the bar for death metal.[200] It had a significant influence on the genre leaders such as Death, Obituary, Cannibal Corpse, Morbid Angel and Napalm Death.[201] The album was hailed the \"heaviest album of all time\" by Kerrang!,[202] a \"genre-definer\" by Stylus,[203] and a \"stone-cold classic upon its release\" by AllMusic.[204] In 2006, Reign in Blood was named the best metal album of the last 20 years by Metal Hammer.[205] According to Nielsen SoundScan, Slayer sold 4,900,000 copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013.[206]\n\nA lawsuit was brought against the band in 1996, by the parents of Elyse Pahler, who accused the band of encouraging their daughter's murderers through their lyrics.[207] Pahler was drugged, strangled, stabbed, trampled on, and raped as a sacrifice to the devil by three fans of the band.[207] The case was unsealed by the court on May 19, 2000, stating Slayer and related business markets distribute harmful products to teens, encouraging violent acts through their lyrics,[207] and \"none of the vicious crimes committed against Elyse Marie Pahler would have occurred without the intentional marketing strategy of the death-metal band Slayer\".[208] The lawsuit was dismissed in 2001, for multiple reasons including \"principles of free speech, lack of a duty and lack of foreseeability\".[209] A second lawsuit was filed by the parents, an amended complaint for damages against Slayer, their label, and other industry and label entities. The lawsuit was again dismissed. Judge E. Jeffrey Burke stated, \"I do not consider Slayer's music obscene, indecent or harmful to minors.\"[209]\n\nSlayer has been accused of holding Nazi sympathies, due to the band's eagle logo bearing resemblance to the Eagle atop swastika and the lyrics of \"Angel of Death\".[210] \"Angel of Death\" was inspired by the acts of Josef Mengele,[211] the doctor who conducted human experiments on prisoners during World War II at the Auschwitz concentration camp, and was dubbed the \"Angel of Death\" by inmates.[212]\n\nSlayer's cover of Minor Threat's \"Guilty of Being White\" raised questions about a possible message of white supremacy in the band's music. The controversy surrounding the cover involved the changing of the refrain \"guilty of being white\" to \"guilty of being right\", at the song's ending. This incensed Minor Threat frontman Ian MacKaye, who stated \"that is so offensive to me\".[213] King said it was changed for \"tongue-in-cheek\" humor as he thought the allegation of racism at the time was \"ridiculous\".[214]\n\nIn a 2004 interview with Araya, when asked, \"Did critics realize you were wallowing in parody?\". Araya replied, \"No.\u00a0People thought we were serious!...back then you had that PMRC, who literally took everything to heart, when in actuality you're trying to create an image. You're trying to scare people on purpose.\"[215] Araya also denied rumors that Slayer members are Satanists, but they find the subject of Satanism interesting and \"we are all on this planet to learn and experience\".[216]\n\nThe song \"Jihad\" of the album Christ Illusion sparked controversy among families of the September 11 victims.[217] The song deals with the attack from the perspective of a religious terrorist. The band stated the song is spoken through perspective without being sympathetic to the cause, and supports neither side.[217]\n\nSeventeen bus benches promoting the same album in Fullerton, California, were deemed offensive by city officials. City officials contacted the band's record label and demanded that the ads be removed.[218] All benches were eliminated.[219]\n\nIn India, Christ Illusion was recalled by EMI India after protests with Christian religious groups due to the nature of the graphic artwork. The album cover was designed by Slayer's longtime collaborator Larry Carroll and features Christ in a \"sea of despair\", with amputated arms, missing an eye, while standing in a sea of blood with severed heads.[220] Joseph Dias of the Mumbai Christian group Catholic Secular Forum in India took \"strong exception\" to the original album artwork, and issued a memorandum to Mumbai's police commissioner in protest.[221] On October 11, 2006, EMI announced that all stocks had been destroyed, noting it had no plans to re-release the record in India in the future.[220]\n\nCurrent members\n\nFormer members\n\nTouring musicians\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadeth", "content": "\n\nMegadeth is an American thrash metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 by vocalist/guitarist Dave Mustaine. Known for their technically complex guitar work and musicianship, Megadeth is one of the \"big four\" of American thrash metal along with Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer,[3] responsible for the genre's development and popularization. Their music features complex arrangements and fast rhythm sections, dual lead guitars, and lyrical themes of war, politics, religion, death, and personal relationships.\n\nIn 1985, Megadeth released their debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, on the independent record label Combat Records, to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986 and was a major hit with the underground metal scene. Band members' substance abuse issues and personal disputes had brought Megadeth negative publicity during the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the band went on to release a number of platinum-selling albums, including So Far, So Good... So What! (1988), Rust in Peace (1990), and Countdown to Extinction (1992). These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition. Megadeth's most recent album, The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!, was released in 2022.\n\nMegadeth has undergone multiple lineup changes throughout its 41-year career, with Mustaine being the sole consistent member of the band. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without longtime bassist David Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled out of court and rejoined the band in 2010, but was fired in 2021 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Megadeth's current lineup includes Mustaine, bassist James LoMenzo, guitarist Teemu M\u00e4ntysaari and drummer Dirk Verbeuren.\n\nMegadeth earned platinum certifications in the United States for five of its sixteen studio albums,[4] and has received twelve Grammy nominations. Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in 2017 for the song \"Dystopia\" in the Best Metal Performance category.[5] The band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, regularly appears on album artwork and live shows. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since July 2005, and held its first MegaCruise in October 2019. As of 2023[update], the band sold more than fifty million albums worldwide.[6]\n\nOn April 11, 1983, Dave Mustaine was fired from Metallica just prior to the band recording their debut album Kill 'Em All due to substance abuse and personal conflicts with James Hetfield kicking his dog. As Metallica's lead guitarist since 1981, Mustaine had composed some of the group's early songs and helped hone the band into a tight live unit.[7][8] Afterward, Mustaine vowed revenge by forming a band that was faster and heavier than Metallica.[9] On the bus trip back to Los Angeles, Mustaine found a pamphlet by California senator Alan Cranston that read: \"The arsenal of megadeath can't be rid no matter what the peace treaties come to.\"[10] The term \"Megadeath\" stuck with Mustaine and he wrote a song with that title with the spelling slightly changed to Megadeth, which, according to Mustaine, represented the annihilation of power.[11]\n\nAfter arriving back in Los Angeles, Mustaine began the search for new bandmates for his band. He formed the band Fallen Angels, which included Lor Kane on vocals, Robby McKinney on guitar and Matt Kisselstein on bass, in April 1983.[12] The band's name was changed to Megadeth on Kane's recommendation.[13] As the founder, Mustaine added his new neighbors David Ellefson and Greg Handevidt to the band, who had moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles and played bass and guitar, respectively.[14] Ellefson has stated that Handevidt, rather than Kane, came up with the idea to change the band name.[15] A demo was recorded by the lineup (which had expanded to include Richard Girod on drums),[16] though the band realized that they would have to retool some of the songs following the release of Metallica's debut album, in July 1983.[17] The only Metallica-era song that ended up on Megadeth's debut album was \"Mechanix\".[18] Songs from that time period included \"No Time\", \"Self Destruct\", \"Hair Pin Trigger\", \"Speak No Evil\", \"Eye for Eye\" and \"Heaven Knows\".[16] \"Speak No Evil\" was the original title of \"Looking Down the Cross\",[19] while \"No Time\" was an early title for \"Set the World Afire\" and \"Self Destruct\" was the original title for \"Mary Jane.\"[20]\n\nWhile Handevidt would only last a few months, Mustaine and Ellefson formed a tight musical bond. Despite his enthusiasm, Mustaine had trouble finding other members to fill out the lineup. He and Ellefson auditioned about 15 drummers, hoping to find one who understood meter changes in music. After briefly playing with Dijon Carruthers, they selected Lee Rauch. Following six months of trying to find a lead singer, Mustaine decided to perform lead vocals himself.[21] Singers who temporarily joined the band included Billy Bonds[18] and John Cyriis, who would found Agent Steel after his firing from Megadeth.[22]\n\nIn 1984, Megadeth recorded a three-song demo tape featuring Mustaine, Ellefson, and Rauch.[23] The demo tape, Last Rites, was released on March 9, 1984. It featured early versions of \"Last Rites/Loved to Death\", \"The Skull Beneath the Skin\", and \"Mechanix\", all of which appeared on the band's debut album.[24] The band was unable to find a compatible second guitarist. Kerry King of Slayer filled in on rhythm guitar for several shows in the San Francisco area in 1984, starting with the debut gig on February 17 at Ruthie's Inn in Berkeley, California,[25] as well as a gig at The Keystone in Berkeley that April[26] and would play five shows in total with the band.[27] King went back to Slayer and Rauch was replaced with jazz fusion drummer Gar Samuelson.[28] Samuelson officially joined Megadeth on October 24, 1984.[29] Samuelson had previously been in the jazz band The New Yorkers with guitarist Chris Poland.[30] After seeing Samuelson perform with Megadeth as a trio, Poland went backstage and suggested an impromptu audition as lead guitarist for the band; he joined Megadeth in December 1984.[9]\n\nAfter considering several labels, Mustaine signed the band to Combat Records, a New York-based Independent record label that offered Megadeth the highest budget to record and tour.[31] In 1985, Combat Records gave the band $8,000 to record and produce its debut album. After spending $4,000 of the budget on drugs, alcohol, and food, the band fired the original producer and finished the recording themselves.[32]\n\nDespite its low-fidelity sound,[33] Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was relatively successful in underground metal circles and attracted major-label interest.[34] The band was calling itself State Of The Art Speed Metal.[35] Music writer Joel McIver praised its \"blistering technicality\" and stated that the album \"raised the bar for the whole thrash metal scene, with guitarists forced to perform even more accurately and powerfully\".[36] The front cover marked the debut of band mascot Vic Rattlehead, who regularly appeared on subsequent album artwork.[37]\n\nKilling Is My Business... and Business Is Good! features \"Mechanix\", a song Mustaine wrote during his time with Metallica. Though Mustaine told the band after his dismissal not to use the music he had written, Metallica recorded a different version of the song, \"The Four Horsemen\", with a slower tempo and a melodic middle section.[38] The album also included a cover of Nancy Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\u2009\", at a faster tempo and with altered lyrics. Megadeth's version generated controversy during the 1990s, when its writer, Lee Hazlewood, called Mustaine's changes \"vile and offensive\".[39] Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from pressings released from 1995 to 2001.[40]\n\nIn mid-1985, on a bill with Canadian speed metal band Exciter, Megadeth played its first North American tour: the Killing for a Living Tour. Guitarist Mike Albert replaced Poland, who was battling drug addiction.[41] Although Albert was originally supposed to be a permanent replacement,[31] Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, shortly before the group began recording its second album for Combat.[42]\n\nAccording to Mustaine, Megadeth was under pressure to deliver another successful album: \"That sophomore offering is the 'be-all or end-all' of any band. You either go to the next level, or it's the beginning of the nadir.\"[43] Mustaine composed the music for the album, with the other members adding arrangement ideas.[44]\n\nThe album was produced on a $25,000 budget from Combat Records. Dissatisfied with its financial limitations, the band left Combat and signed with Capitol Records. Capitol bought the rights to the album, and hired producer Paul Lani to remix the earlier recordings. Released in late 1986, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? has clearer production and more sophisticated songwriting.[45] Mustaine wanted to write socially conscious lyrics, unlike mainstream heavy metal bands who sang about \"hedonistic pleasures\".[46] The album was noted for its political commentary and helped Megadeth expand its fanbase.[47] The title track was the album's second single, and was accompanied by a music video that received regular airplay on MTV.[48]\n\nIn February 1987, Megadeth was the opening act on Alice Cooper's Constrictor tour,[49] and the following month began its first headlining world tour in the United Kingdom. The 72-week tour was supported by Overkill and Necros, and continued in the United States.[50] During the tour, Mustaine and Ellefson considered firing Samuelson for his drug abuse.[51] According to Mustaine, Samuelson had become too much to handle when intoxicated. Drummer Chuck Behler traveled with Megadeth for the last dates of the tour as the other band members feared Samuelson would not be able to continue.[52] Poland quarreled with Mustaine, and was accused of selling band equipment to buy heroin.[51] As a result, Samuelson and Poland were asked to leave Megadeth in 1987, with Behler becoming the band's full-time drummer.[50]\n\nPoland was initially replaced by Jay Reynolds of Malice, but as the band began working on its next record, Reynolds was replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young, when Megadeth was six weeks into the recording of its third album.[52]\n\nWith a major-label budget, the Paul Lani-produced So Far, So Good... So What! took over five months to record. The production was plagued with problems, partially due to Mustaine's struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: \"The production of So Far, So Good... So What! was horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn't have at the time.\" Mustaine clashed with Lani, beginning with Lani's insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers.[53] Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the mixing, and Lani was replaced by Michael Wagener, who remixed the album.[54]\n\nSo Far, So Good... So What! was released in January 1988 and was well received by fans and critics.[55] The album featured a cover version of the Sex Pistols' \"Anarchy in the U.K.\"; Mustaine changed the lyrics, later saying that he had simply heard them incorrectly. To support the album, Megadeth embarked on a world tour that lasted for nearly eight months. The band (along with Savatage) opened for Dio on the Dream Evil tour and supported Iron Maiden on their Seventh Son of a Seventh Son tour, both in the United States.[56] They also headlined a North American tour with Warlock and Sanctuary (whose debut album Refuge Denied was produced by Mustaine), and a European trek with Testament, Nuclear Assault, Flotsam and Jetsam and Sanctuary.[57]\n\nIn June 1988, Megadeth appeared in Penelope Spheeris' documentary The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years.[58] The documentary chronicled the Los Angeles heavy metal scene of the late 1980s, and Spheeris, who had directed Megadeth in the video for \"Wake Up Dead\", decided to include them to feature a more serious band in contrast to the glam metal groups.[59][60] Mustaine remembered the film as a disappointment, as it aligned Megadeth with \"a bunch of shit bands\".[61]\n\nIn August, the band appeared at the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in the United Kingdom, performing to an audience of more than 100,000. One show featured a guest appearance by Metallica drummer (and Mustaine's former bandmate) Lars Ulrich. The band was added to the Monsters of Rock European tour, but left after the first show due to Ellefson's drug problems, for which he was treated immediately.[62] Megadeth was replaced by Testament.[63]\n\nShortly after the Monsters of Rock appearance, Mustaine fired Behler and Young and canceled Megadeth's Australian tour. \"On the road, things escalated from a small border skirmish into a full-on raging war,\" Mustaine later recalled. \"I think a lot of us were inconsistent because of [drugs].\"[64] During the tour, Mustaine noticed problems developing with Behler and brought in drummer Nick Menza as Behler's drum technician. As with Samuelson, Menza was expected to take over if Behler could not continue the tour. Menza replaced Behler in 1989.[65] Young's dismissal resulted from Mustaine's suspicions that he was having an affair with Mustaine's then-girlfriend, an allegation Young denied.[66]\n\nThe band was unable to quickly find a suitable replacement for Young. Although 1989 marked the first time since its inception that Megadeth did not tour nor perform at least one show, they recorded a cover version of Alice Cooper's \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" which appeared on the soundtrack to the Wes Craven horror movie Shocker.[67] The video was directed by Penelope Spheeris, who recalled the filming as a \"Herculean task\" as Mustaine was unable to play guitar because of his drug addiction.[58] During the March 1989 auditions for a new lead guitarist, Mustaine was arrested for driving under the influence and possession of narcotics after crashing into a parked vehicle occupied by an off-duty police officer.[68] Mustaine entered court-ordered drug rehabilitation shortly afterwards, and became drug-free for the first time in ten years.[58]\n\nWith Mustaine sober, Megadeth continued searching for a new lead guitarist. Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash had been jamming with Mustaine and Ellefson, and although it seemed that he might join Megadeth, he remained with Guns N' Roses.[69] Dimebag Darrell of Pantera was offered the job, but the deal fell through after Mustaine refused his request to recruit his brother, Pantera drummer Vinnie Paul, as he had already hired Menza.[70] The offer was also extended to Criss Oliva who also declined as he did not want to leave Savatage.[71] Jeff Loomis, who would later go on to form progressive metal titans Nevermore, also auditioned though Mustaine deemed him too young to join as Loomis was only 18 at the time.[72]\n\nMarty Friedman filled the guitarist position at the recommendation of Ron Laffitte, a member of Capitol management. Laffitte had heard Dragon's Kiss, a solo recording by Friedman when he was in Cacophony.[73] Mustaine and Ellefson were satisfied with Friedman's style and thought that he understood Megadeth's music.[74] With Friedman in the group, the band completed what fans consider the definitive Megadeth lineup.[75] The revitalized band entered the studio at Rumbo Recorders in March 1990 with co-producer Mike Clink to begin Megadeth's most critically acclaimed album, Rust in Peace. Clink was the first producer to complete a Megadeth album without being fired.[76] Its recording was documented in Rusted Pieces, a home video released in 1991 with six music videos and an interview with the band.[77]\n\nReleased in September 1990, Rust in Peace debuted at number 23 in the United States and number eight in the United Kingdom.[78][79] Mustaine had developed a writing style with a rhythmically complex, progressive edge, and the songs featured longer guitar solos and frequent tempo changes.[80] Described as a genre-defining work by Decibel,[73] the album solidified Megadeth's reputation in the music industry.[21] It features the singles \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" and \"Hangar 18\", both of which were accompanied by music videos and became live staples. Rust in Peace received a Grammy nomination in 1991 for Best Metal Performance,[5][81] and was the group's third platinum album, certified in December 1994.[82]\n\nEarly in 1990, Megadeth joined Slayer, Testament, and Suicidal Tendencies for the successful European Clash of the Titans tour, featuring several American thrash metal bands.[83] An American leg began the following year featuring Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, with Alice in Chains as a supporting act. The tour was considered a multi-headliner, as the three main bands alternated time slots.[84] In addition to the Clash of the Titans tour, Megadeth (along with Testament) supported Judas Priest on their Painkiller tour in North America late in 1990 and appeared at the second Rock in Rio festival in January 1991.[85] In July 1991 the song \"Go to Hell\" was featured in the film Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey and on its soundtrack.[86]\n\nThe music for Megadeth's fifth studio album was written in two different sessions. The first session occurred after the conclusion of the Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session happened in the fall of 1991 following a one-month break.[87] Recording sessions for the album began in January 1992 at Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California. Max Norman was chosen to produce, as the band was pleased with his mixing of Rust in Peace.[88] Megadeth spent nearly four months in the studio with Norman, writing and recording what became the band's most commercially successful album, Countdown to Extinction.[89] The album, whose title was suggested by Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member.[90] Ellefson explained that the band changed its approach to songwriting for this album, beginning to write more melodic songs.[91]\n\nReleased in July 1992, Countdown to Extinction entered the Billboard 200 chart at number two and was certified double platinum in the United States.[3][4][93] It received a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 1993 Grammy Awards,[94] and its title track won a Genesis Award from the Humane Society in 1993 for raising awareness for animal rights issues.[95] Ellefson later said that he and Friedman were disappointed that Megadeth did not win the Grammy: \"It was such a bizarre moment, because it was as if the amount of work it had taken to ramp up to that hopeful night was literally gone in a second.\"[96]\n\nA world tour in support of the album was launched in late 1992, with Pantera and White Zombie as supporting acts.[96] The tour included a North American leg in early 1993, with Stone Temple Pilots as the opening act. One month into the leg, the remaining shows, including dates in Japan, were canceled when Mustaine returned to substance abuse, ending up in a hospital emergency room.[97] After seven weeks in rehab, Mustaine emerged sober again and the band returned to the studio to record \"Angry Again\". The song is featured on the soundtrack of the 1993 film Last Action Hero and received a Grammy nomination in 1994.[98]\n\nDuring mid-1993, Megadeth performed at a number of shows with Metallica in Europe. The first was at Milton Keynes Bowl in England, and included Diamond Head.[96] In July, Megadeth was added as the opening act for Aerosmith's Get a Grip Tour, but was removed from the bill after three shows.[99] Aerosmith said that Megadeth was \"dumped\" because of Mustaine's erratic behavior, while Capitol Records said it was due to \"artistic restrictions\".[100] After the canceled US tour, Megadeth returned to the studio to record \"99 Ways to Die\", which appeared on The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience, a compilation album released in November featuring songs interspersed with commentary by the main characters of the animated series Beavis and Butt-Head. The song was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1995 Grammy Awards.[101] During these sessions, Megadeth recorded a cover version of Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\", which appeared on the Black Sabbath tribute album Nativity in Black; it was nominated for a Grammy the following year.[102]\n\nIn early 1994, Megadeth reunited with producer Max Norman for the follow-up to Countdown to Extinction. With three band members living in Arizona, initial work began at Phase Four Studios in Phoenix.[103] A few days into pre-production, problems with Phase Four's equipment forced the band to look for another studio. Mustaine insisted on recording in Arizona, but no suitable recording facility could be found. At Norman's request, the band built its own recording studio in Phoenix in a rented warehouse, later called \"Fat Planet in Hangar 18\".[104] During the studio's construction, much of the pre-production songwriting and arrangements were done at Vintage Recorders in Phoenix.[50] At Norman's suggestion, the tracks on Youthanasia had a slower tempo than previous albums, at about 120 beats per minute.[105] The band abandoned the progressive approach from its previous albums and focused on stronger vocal melodies and more accessible, radio-friendly arrangements.[106] For the first time, Megadeth wrote and arranged the entire album in the studio, including basic tracks recorded live by the entire band. The album's recording was video recorded and released as Evolver: The Making of Youthanasia in 1995.\n\nAfter eight months of studio work, Youthanasia was released in November 1994. It debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and charted in several European countries.[107] The album was certified gold in Canada the day it was released,[108] and was certified platinum in the US two months later.[4] Megadeth hired fashion photographer Richard Avedon to enhance the band's image. Avedon had the band members exchange their jeans and T-shirts for a more conscious appearance.[109] To promote Youthanasia, the band played a Halloween show in New York City called \"Night of the Living Megadeth\", which was broadcast live on MTV.[105] In November, the band performed twice on the Late Show with David Letterman, playing \"Train of Consequences\" on the first appearance and \"A Tout le Monde\" on the second.[110][111]\n\nAn eleven-month tour began in South America in November 1994. In 1995, Megadeth played in Europe and North America with several opening acts, including Corrosion of Conformity, Korn and Fear Factory.[112] The tour culminated with an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival in Brazil, co-headlining with Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osbourne.[113] In January 1995, Megadeth appeared on the soundtrack of the horror movie Demon Knight with the song \"Diadems\".[114] In July, Megadeth released Hidden Treasures, an extended play featuring songs which originally appeared on movie soundtracks and tribute albums.[115]\n\nAfter completing the extensive world tour in support of Youthanasia, Megadeth took time off in most of 1996 and nearly broke up.[116] During this period, Mustaine began work on MD.45, a side project with vocalist Lee Ving of Fear. The majority of the songs on the album were intended for Megadeth, but due to the band almost disbanding, Mustaine decided to use them for MD.45 instead.[116] The duo hired drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, who had played with Alice Cooper on the South American Monsters of Rock tour earlier that year.[117] Marty Friedman built a studio in his new home in Phoenix and completed his fourth solo album, released in April 1996.[118]\n\nIn September 1996, Megadeth went to London to work on songs for the next album. The songwriting was closely supervised by new manager Bud Prager, who contributed musical ideas and lyrics; many lyrics and song titles were changed at his request.[119] Regarding Prager's influence, Mustaine later wrote: \"I figured maybe this guy [Prager] could help me get that intangible number one record I so badly wanted.\"[120] The album, recorded in Nashville, was Megadeth's first collaboration with country pop producer Dann Huff, who had met Mustaine in 1990.[121]\n\nCryptic Writings was released in June 1997. The album peaked at number ten on the Billboard 200,[78] and was eventually certified gold in the United States. Its lead single, \"Trust\", became Megadeth's highest charting song on the Mainstream Rock Tracks at number five,[122] and was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 1998 Grammy Awards.[123] Although all four singles from the album entered the top 20 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart,[124] press response to the album was mixed. The album featured a diverse set of songs which the Los Angeles Times described as a \"rousing balance\" between older material and experimental songs.[125] Asked about the album's eclecticism, Mustaine said that Cryptic Writings was divided into thirds. One part was based around faster, more aggressive material, another was \"radio-orientated music like Youthanasia\", and the final third was more melodic.[118]\n\nAfter more than a year since the band's last concert, Megadeth returned as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and touring in the United States with Life of Agony and Coal Chamber.[113] In July, the band participated in Ozzfest '98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery.[126] Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza for the remainder of the tour.[127] Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because he believed the drummer had lied about having cancer.[70]\n\nFollowing the band's mainstream radio success with Cryptic Writings, Megadeth again worked with Dann Huff on its eighth studio album. The band began writing in January 1999, supervised by manager Bud Prager, who was credited with co-writing five of the album's twelve songs.[128] With high expectations following the chart success of \"Trust\", Prager convinced Mustaine to grant Huff even more control over the album's recording, a decision Mustaine later regretted.[129]\n\nRisk, released in August 1999, was a critical and commercial failure and led to backlash from many longtime fans. Although its two predecessors incorporated rock elements alongside a more traditional heavy metal sound, Risk was virtually devoid of metal.[130][131] About the band's musical direction, Dave Mustaine said: \"We hit the nadir of our career with Risk, and I vowed after that we were going to get back to our roots. It took a little bit of time to do that.\"[132] Despite this, Risk was certified gold in the United States.[133][failed verification] The album's lead single, \"Crush 'Em\", appeared on the soundtrack for Universal Soldier: The Return and was used as an entrance theme for NHL hockey games and professional wrestling events.[134]\n\nOn July 14, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died of liver failure at age 41 in Orange City, Florida.[135] Eleven days later, during Megadeth's performance at Woodstock 1999, Mustaine dedicated \"Peace Sells\" to Samuelson's memory. That month, Megadeth also recorded a cover version of the Black Sabbath's \"Never Say Die\" for the second Nativity in Black tribute album.[136] The band began a world tour in support of Risk in September, playing with Iron Maiden during the European leg. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced his resignation from Megadeth, citing musical differences.[137] Mustaine later said: \"I told [Marty] after Risk that we had to go back to our roots and play metal, and he quit.\"[138]\n\nIn January 2000, guitarist Al Pitrelli, formerly of Savatage and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, became Friedman's replacement.[139] Megadeth returned to the studio in April to work on its ninth studio album. A month into production, the band received an offer to join the Maximum Rock tour with Anthrax and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Megadeth put the recording on hold and toured North America during the second quarter of 2000.[113] Early in the tour, Anthrax was removed from the bill, allowing Megadeth to play an extended co-headlining set.[140] The tour, however, suffered from poor ticket sales.[141]\n\nAfter 15 years with Capitol Records, Megadeth left the label in July 2000. According to Mustaine, the departure was due to ongoing tensions with Capitol management.[142] Capitol returned the band's newest recordings and released a greatest hits album, Capitol Punishment: The Megadeth Years, with two new tracks: \"Kill the King\" and \"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\".[143] In November, Megadeth signed with Sanctuary Records. The band returned to the studio in October to finish its next album, The World Needs a Hero, which was near completion when Megadeth joined the Maximum Rock tour six months earlier. Following the negative response to Risk,[144] Mustaine fired Bud Prager and produced the album himself.[145] The songs were written by Mustaine alone, except for \"Promises\", which had contributions from Pitrelli.[146] Two days before the release of The World Needs a Hero, Megadeth appeared in an episode of VH1's Behind the Music showcasing Mustaine, Ellefson, several past members, and Mustaine's old Metallica bandmates James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.[147]\n\nThe World Needs a Hero was released in May 2001 and debuted at number sixteen on the Billboard 200. It was banned in Malaysia when the national government determined that the album's artwork was \"unsuitable for the nation's youth\". Consequently, the band canceled its concert of August 2 in Kuala Lumpur.[148] The album marked Megadeth's return to a more aggressive sound after the stylistic variations of its previous two albums,[146] but critics felt it fell short of expectations.[149] Mustaine compared the album to a huge ship at sea, turning and trying to right itself to get back on course.[142] Its lead single, \"Moto Psycho\", reached number 22 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.[150]\n\nA European tour with AC/DC in support of The World Needs a Hero began in mid-2001, followed by an American tour with Iced Earth and Endo in September.[147] Mustaine allowed fans to choose the setlist in each American city.[148] However, the tour was cut short following the September 11 attacks; all dates were canceled, including a DVD shoot in Argentina. The band instead played two shows in Arizona on November 16 and 17, which were filmed and released as Megadeth's first live release, Rude Awakening.[151] That year, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! was remixed and remastered; the reissue featured modified artwork and several bonus tracks.[152]\n\nIn January 2002, Mustaine was hospitalized for the removal of a kidney stone and was administered pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas. While there, Mustaine fell asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair, causing compression of the radial nerve. He was subsequently diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or make a fist with his left hand.[153][154]\n\nOn April 3, Mustaine announced in a press release that he was disbanding Megadeth, as his arm injury rendered him unable to play guitar.[155] For the next four months, he had physical therapy five days a week, and slowly began to \"re-teach\" his left hand.[156] To fulfill contract obligations to Sanctuary, Megadeth released the compilation album Still Alive... and Well?. The first half of the album contains live tracks recorded at the Web Theatre in Phoenix, and the second half has studio recordings from The World Needs a Hero.[157]\n\nFollowing nearly a year of recovery, including physical therapy,[158] Mustaine began work on what was to have been his first solo album. The recording sessions for the new material, with session musicians Vinnie Colaiuta and Jimmie Lee Sloas[failed verification], began in October 2003[159] and were completed in April 2004.[160] The project was put on hold when Mustaine agreed to remix and remaster Megadeth's eight-album back catalog on Capitol Records,[161] re-recording portions that were missing.[162]\n\nIn May 2004, Mustaine returned to his solo project. Contractual obligations to the band's European label, EMI, resulted in the recording's release as a Megadeth album.[163] Mustaine reformed the band and contacted the fan-favorite Rust in Peace lineup to re-record backing tracks. While drummer Nick Menza agreed to return, both Marty Friedman and David Ellefson were unable to come to an agreement with Mustaine.[164] Menza was sent home shortly after rehearsals began, a few days before the start of a tour supporting Megadeth's upcoming album. Mustaine said Menza was insufficiently prepared for the physical demands of a US tour, and \"it just didn't work out\".[165] This was the first album without Ellefson. Chris Poland, who played lead guitar on Megadeth's first two albums, was hired to contribute guitar solos to the new album, working with Mustaine for the first time since the 1990s. Poland opted to serve only as a session musician, wanting to remain focused on his jazz fusion project OHM.[166]\n\nThe System Has Failed was released in September 2004. Critics heralded it as a return to form; Revolver gave the album a favorable review, calling it \"Megadeth's most vengeful, poignant and musically complex offering since 1992's Countdown to Extinction\".[167] The album marked a shift toward the band's earlier sound; journalist Amy Sciarretto of CMJ New Music Report wrote that the album contained \"neo-thrash riffing with biting, politically charged lyrics\".[168] The System Has Failed debuted at number eighteen on the Billboard 200[78] and was led by \"Die Dead Enough\", which reached number 21 on the US Mainstream Rock chart.[150] Mustaine announced that the album would be the band's last and would be followed by a farewell tour, after which he would focus on a solo career.[169]\n\nMegadeth began the Blackmail the Universe world tour in October, enlisting touring bassist James MacDonough of Iced Earth and guitarist Glen Drover of Eidolon and King Diamond. Five days before the first show, Menza was replaced by Shawn Drover, who remained with the band as a regular member.[170] The band toured the US with Exodus and Europe with Diamond Head and Dungeon.[171][172] In June 2005, Capitol released a greatest-hits compilation, Greatest Hits: Back to the Start, featuring remixed and remastered versions of songs chosen by fans from Megadeth's Capitol albums.[173]\n\nIn mid-2005, Mustaine organized an annual thrash metal festival tour, Gigantour. Megadeth headlined the inaugural tour with acts such as Dream Theater, Nevermore, Anthrax, and Fear Factory. Performances at the Montreal and Vancouver shows were filmed and recorded for a live DVD-and-CD set released in the second quarter of 2006.[174] On October 9, following the successes of The System Has Failed and the Blackmail the Universe world tour, Mustaine announced to a sold-out crowd at the Pepsi Music Rock Festival in Argentina that Megadeth would continue to record and tour.[175] The concert, held at Obras Sanitarias stadium in Buenos Aires in front of 25,000 fans, was filmed and released on DVD as That One Night: Live in Buenos Aires in 2007.[176]\n\nIn February 2006, bassist James MacDonough left the band over \"personal differences\".[177] He was replaced by James LoMenzo, who had worked with David Lee Roth, White Lion, and Black Label Society.[178] The new Megadeth lineup made its live debut headlining the Dubai Desert Rock Festival in the United Arab Emirates with Testament.[179] In March, Capitol released a two-disc DVD, Arsenal of Megadeth, which included archive footage, interviews, live shows, and many of the band's music videos. Due to licensing issues, soundtrack and non-Capitol videos were not included.[180] The second Gigantour began during the third quarter of 2006; Megadeth again headlined, this time with Lamb of God, Opeth, Arch Enemy and Overkill.[181] The 2006 tour included three dates in Australia, supported by Soulfly, Arch Enemy, and Caliban.[182]\n\nIn May 2006, Megadeth announced that its eleventh studio album, United Abominations, was near completion. Originally scheduled for release in October, Mustaine said that the band was \"putting the finishing touches on it\" and postponed its release to May of the following year.[183] He commented on the release: \"Metal needs a really good old-school record again. I believe I have delivered.\"[184] United Abominations was the band's first album to feature Glen Drover, Shawn Drover, and James Lomenzo. It also has a newer version of \"A Tout le Monde\" entitled \"\u00c0 Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)\". The 2007 version is a duet with Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil; it was recorded at a slightly faster tempo than the original and contains an extended solo.[185]\n\nReleased in May 2007, United Abominations debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200, selling 54,000 copies in the first week.[186] In March, Megadeth began a North American tour opening for the newly reformed Heaven & Hell. The band played with Down for Canadian shows and with Machine Head for the US dates.[187] A European summer festival tour followed. Late in the year, Megadeth returned to the United States to headline its Tour of Duty.[188] In November, the band brought Gigantour to Australia with a lineup including Static-X, DevilDriver and Lacuna Coil.[189]\n\nIn January 2008, Glen Drover quit Megadeth, stating that he was tired of the frequent touring and wanted to spend more time with his family. He also cited personal issues with other band members.[190] Drover was replaced by Chris Broderick, formerly of Nevermore and Jag Panzer.[191] Broderick was initially asked by Mustaine's management company at the end of 2007 if he would be interested in auditioning for Megadeth. After an informal meeting at Mustaine's house, Broderick was introduced as the band's new guitarist.[192] Mustaine complimented Broderick's playing skills and called him \"the best guitarist Megadeth has ever had\".[193] Broderick's former Nevermore bandmate, Van Williams, congratulated Megadeth on \"getting one hell of a good player, more importantly they're getting a great guy to hang out with and a true friend\".[194]\n\nThe new lineup made its live debut at the Helsinki Ice Hall on February 4. The 2008 Gigantour, with 29 North American dates, began shortly afterwards.[195] Mustaine wanted a shorter lineup, allowing each band a chance to perform well. The third tour featured In Flames, Children of Bodom, Job for a Cowboy and High on Fire.[196] Megadeth continued the Tour of Duty in South America and Mexico in May and June. A compilation album, Anthology: Set the World Afire, was released in September 2008.[197]\n\nIn February 2009, Megadeth and Testament were scheduled on the European \"Priest Feast\" tour, with Judas Priest as headliners.[198] At this time, Metallica, who had been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, invited Mustaine to attend the ceremony. Mustaine was informed that he would not be inducted to the Hall of Fame because such honors were granted only to those members who received recording credit on a Metallica album.[199] Mustaine congratulated the group respectfully, and honored his commitment to the European tour with Judas Priest.[200] In April, Megadeth and Slayer co-headlined the Canadian Carnage. This was the first time they had performed together in more than 15 years. Machine Head and Suicide Silence opened for the four shows that occurred later in June.[201]\n\nIn May, Megadeth finished recording its twelfth album, Endgame.[202] The release date for Endgame was announced on the Megadeth official website, and Metal Hammer was the first to review the album track-by-track.[203] Megadeth began its Endgame tour in October, and finished it in December. The tour featured a number of supporting acts, including Machine Head, Suicide Silence, and Warbringer.[204] In January 2010, Megadeth was set to embark on the American Carnage tour with Slayer and Testament, but the tour was postponed due to Tom Araya's back surgery.[205] Several weeks later, Megadeth's \"Head Crusher\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2010 Grammy Awards, the band's eighth Grammy nomination in 19 years.[206]\n\nIn March, Megadeth embarked on the Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour, which took place in North America and had support from Testament and Exodus. During the tour, Megadeth played Rust in Peace in its entirety.[207] Prior to the start of the tour, original bassist David Ellefson rejoined Megadeth after eight years. In an interview for Classic Rock, he stated that Shawn Drover contacted him, informing him that bassist LoMenzo was leaving the band, saying \"if ever there was a time for you and Dave [Mustaine] to talk, now is it\".[208]\n\nMegadeth, along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, collectively known as the \"big four\" of thrash metal, agreed to perform on the same bill during mid-2010. These performances were part of the Sonisphere Festival and were held in a number of European countries.[209] One such performance in Sofia, Bulgaria, was filmed and released as a full-length video entitled The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria.[210] These shows continued the following year in the United States. The first took place in Indio, California, and was the only scheduled show in the United States at the time,[211] although a second American production was held at Yankee Stadium in New York City shortly afterwards.[212]\n\nIn July 2010, after the European \"big four\" shows, Megadeth and Slayer commenced the first leg of the American Carnage Tour, where Megadeth played Rust in Peace in its entirety, while Slayer performed its album Seasons in the Abyss, both of which were released in 1990.[213] From these shows onward, Vic Rattlehead started making sustained onstage appearances, to improve the visual facet of Megadeth's live performances.[214] Shortly afterward, the two bands united with Anthrax for the J\u00e4germeister Music Tour in late 2010.[215] During the final show of the tour, Kerry King joined Megadeth on stage at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Hollywood to perform Megadeth's \"Rattlehead\". It was the first time that King had performed onstage with Megadeth since 1984.[216] Megadeth and Slayer again shared the stage for the European Carnage Tour in March and April 2011.[217] Megadeth also headlined the fourth annual Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August the same year.[218]\n\nIn September, the band released the DVD album Rust in Peace Live, recorded at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles.[219] Later that month, Megadeth released \"Sudden Death\" for the video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock.[220] The song was commissioned by the publishers of the Guitar Hero franchise, who wanted the track to feature dark lyrics and multiple guitar solos.[221] It was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2011 Grammy ceremony.[222]\n\nMegadeth returned to its own Vic's Garage studio in 2011 to record its thirteenth album, to be produced by Johnny K, because Andy Sneap, the producer of Megadeth's previous two albums, was unavailable.[223] The album was titled Thirteen and featured previously released tracks such as \"Sudden Death\" and \"Never Dead\".[224] The album was released in November 2011, and charted at number eleven on the Billboard 200; its lead single \"Public Enemy No.\u00a01\" received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance, but did not win.[225] Shortly after the album was released, Dave Mustaine stated that, after a four-year hiatus, there would be a new Gigantour tour in early 2012.[226] The lineup consisted of Mot\u00f6rhead, Volbeat, and Lacuna Coil alongside Megadeth.[227] After the conclusion of Gigantour, Rob Zombie and Megadeth embarked on a nine-date co-headlining US tour in the summer of 2012.[228]\n\nIn September 2012, it was announced that Megadeth would re-release Countdown to Extinction in honor of the album's 20th anniversary. To mark the occasion, Megadeth launched a tour in which the band performed the album live in its entirety.[229] One performance, filmed at the Pomona Fox Theater, was released as a live album, Countdown to Extinction: Live, the following year.[230] Another track from Thirteen, \"Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)\", was nominated for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards, but lost to Halestorm's \"Love Bites (So Do I)\".[231]\n\nIn August, Megadeth announced the recording of its fourteenth album with producer Johnny K.[232] At the start of 2013, Megadeth left Roadrunner Records for Mustaine's newly founded label, Tradecraft, distributed through Universal Music Group.[233][234] The album, Super Collider, was released in June and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, the band's highest chart position since 1994's Youthanasia.[235] Critical reaction to the album, however, was largely negative, with criticism directed towards the album's deviation from the band's traditional metal sound.[236] Shortly after the release of Super Collider, Mustaine stated that he had already started thinking about a fifteenth Megadeth album. He said this had been spurred by the death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which gave him a sense of mortality.[237] Mustaine elaborated: \"You know, time is short. Nobody knows how long they're gonna live. You see what happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can.\"[238]\n\nThe 2013 edition of Gigantour featured Black Label Society, Hellyeah, Device, and Newsted as opening bands.[239] At the final show, Jason Newsted, Metallica's former bassist, joined Megadeth onstage to perform \"Phantom Lord\", a song Mustaine had co-written during his stint with Metallica.[240] Early in 2014, Megadeth was slated to play the Soundwave festival in Australia, but pulled out over a disagreement with tour promoter A.\u00a0J. Maddah concerning the band's sideshows with Newsted.[241] Icon, an eleven-song compilation of Megadeth's Capitol-era material, was released as part of Universal Music's Icon series in February.[242]\n\nMegadeth encountered several setbacks throughout 2014. After Ellefson's brother died of cancer in May, the band cancelled its June tour dates to allow him to mourn.[243] A planned August concert in Tel Aviv was canceled due to an armed conflict between Israel and Gaza.[244] Megadeth was scheduled to appear on Mot\u00f6rhead's Mot\u00f6rboat cruise in late September, but withdrew because of Mustaine's complications following his cervical spine surgery.[245] In late November, Drover quit the band after ten years, wanting to pursue his own musical interests, but has said he is grateful for the career Mustaine gave him.[246] This was quickly followed by the departure of Broderick, due to artistic and musical differences.[247] Ellefson denied rumors that Megadeth would disband, and said he and Mustaine would continue working on new music.[248] Mustaine later said one of the reasons for Broderick and Drover leaving was their frustration over Megadeth's fan base demanding a reunion with Friedman and Menza.[249]\n\nLamb of God drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Kiko Loureiro of Angra were brought in to perform on Megadeth's fifteenth studio album after Mustaine unsuccessfully attempted to reunite the Rust in Peace lineup.[250] In October 2015, Megadeth streamed \"Fatal Illusion\" off the album Dystopia, which was released in January 2016.[251] In support of Dystopia, Megadeth embarked on a North American tour in February and March with Suicidal Tendencies, Children of Bodom and Havok (though Havok was soon removed from the tour by Megadeth's management following a dispute over a contract).[252] Mustaine announced that Adler, who was performing with both Lamb of God and Megadeth, was no longer in the band due to scheduling conflicts between the two bands. He was replaced by Dirk Verbeuren from Soilwork, on Adler's recommendation.[253] A second US tour took place in September and October, with support from Amon Amarth, Suicidal Tendencies, Metal Church,[254] and Butcher Babies.[255] Former drummer Menza died of a heart attack on May 21, 2016, while performing with OHM at a jazz club in Los Angeles.[256]\n\nAsked about any further Big Four gigs, Mustaine called for \"the powers-that-be\" to help put together a new Big Four tour in 2017 as all the respective bands were promoting new albums.[257] Dystopia's title track won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 2017 Grammy Awards, the band's first win after 12 nominations.[5] Mustaine, Loureiro, Ellefson, and Verbeuren attended the ceremony; however, album drummer and award recipient Chris Adler[258] did not. While accepting the award, the house band played Mustaine's former band Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" causing some controversy among fans.[259]\n\nIn a June 2017 interview with No Brown M&Ms, Mustaine said that Megadeth would enter the studio at the end of the year to begin working on their sixteenth studio album.[260] A month later, Mustaine stated on Twitter that he had begun \"collecting ideas\" for the new album, but stated that they would \"probably\" enter the studio in mid-2018 to begin recording it for a 2019 release.[261] The band joined with Scorpions for a co-headlining tour in the fall of 2017.[262]\n\nIn 2018, Megadeth marked their 35th anniversary by re-releasing their 1985 debut album Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!, dubbed Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good! - The Final Kill on June 8, 2018, as a deluxe package containing remastered versions of all songs to Mustaine's intended vision, a re-cut version of \"These Boots\" lyrically adjusted to Lee Hazlewood's version, rare live performances of songs off the album during Alice Cooper's Live in the Flesh Tour and the 1984 three song demo.[263]\n\nOn May 10, 2019, Megadeth entered the studio in Franklin, Tennessee, to begin pre-production of the next album, once again teaming up with Dystopia co-producer Chris Rakestraw.[264] On June 17, the band announced that all shows scheduled in 2019 (with the exception of the MegaCruise) would be cancelled due to Mustaine being diagnosed with throat cancer;[265] of all the cancelled dates, the band was scheduled to support Ozzy Osbourne on the North American leg of the No More Tours II tour,[266] which had been postponed from the summer of 2019 to the summer of 2020 due to Osbourne sustaining an injury while dealing with pneumonia. They were replaced by Marilyn Manson instead.[267] Despite Mustaine's illness, the band vowed to continue working on their new album.[268] On November 6, Mustaine shared a video on Instagram teasing a track from the band's upcoming album,[269] which was originally set for release in 2019.[270] On July 17, Megadeth announced their partnership with Gimme Radio and Richard Childress Racing on the No. 2 Gimme Radio Chevrolet Camaro, which was driven by Xfinity Series driver Tyler Reddick at the New Hampshire 200 on July 20.[271] On August 21, the band announced that they would embark on their first tour since Mustaine's illness in January and February 2020, with Five Finger Death Punch and Bad Wolves supporting on the European tour.[272][273]\n\nThe band was originally scheduled to perform on the first-ever MegaCruise to coincide with the release of the next album,[274] due to sail on October 13, 2019, from Los Angeles and hit ports of San Diego and Ensenada before returning on October 18, including performances by heavy metal acts such as Lamb of God, Anthrax, Testament, Overkill, Corrosion of Conformity, Queensr\u00ffche, Armored Saint, Metal Church, Suicidal Tendencies, DragonForce, Doro, John 5, Death Angel and Toothgrinder,[275][276][277][278] however, Mustaine was not present due to his illness. It was instead a live performance featuring members of each respective band playing Kiss songs.[279][280]\n\nMegadeth was originally scheduled to embark on a co-headlining tour in North America with Lamb of God dubbed \"The Metal Tour of the Year\" in the summer of 2020, with Trivium and In Flames as support acts,[281] but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was rescheduled for the summer of 2021,[282] with Hatebreed replacing In Flames due to the latter being forced to withdraw from the line-up due to international visa issues caused by the pandemic.[283] Megadeth re-entered the studio in Nashville in mid-2020 to resume recording their new album, tentatively planned for release in 2021.[284][285][286] While hosting a Masterclass \"Front Row Live\" for fans via Zoom on January 9, 2021, Mustaine announced the title of the band's sixteenth album would be called The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!, however he indicated that the title might be subject to change.[287]\n\nIn May 2021, sexually explicit videos of Ellefson were leaked to social media. The videos, reportedly recorded by a 19-year-old fan who was in correspondence with Ellefson, led to initial accusations of child grooming. Ellefson and the fan denied these claims in separate statements and maintained their encounters were consensual.[288] On May 24, Megadeth issued a statement announcing Ellefson's dismissal from the band.[289] Ellefson later confirmed that he had actually been dismissed ten days earlier on May 14; the videos originally surfaced on May 10.[290] Following the controversy, Mustaine said there would be no chance for Ellefson to rejoin the band, while Ellefson said he would pursue legal action against the leaked videos.[291][292]\n\nOn Mustaine's Gimme Radio program The Dave Mustaine Show on June 17, he said that the bass tracks recorded by Ellefson in May 2020 would not appear on the upcoming album and would be re-recorded by a different bassist,[293] which was completed a short time later, but did not say who it was. He also revealed a song title from the album called \"The Dogs of Chernobyl\".[294] Mustaine confirmed soon after that a new bassist was chosen with a picture showing the neck of the bass guitar and the unknown member being shown on the floor behind a chair, however, he did not reveal the name, but would announce it soon.[295] Former bassist James LoMenzo filled in for the band's upcoming tour with Lamb of God,[296] while Steve Di Giorgio of Testament performed as a session bassist on The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!, which was released in September 2022.[297] LoMenzo was announced as the band's official bassist in May 2022.[298]\n\nAfter several teasers,[299] \"We'll Be Back\", the first single from the record, was released on June 23,[300] along with the tracklist, followed by next singles \"Night Stalkers\" and \"Soldier On!\", released on July 22[301] and August 12[302] respectively.\n\nIn November 2022, the band released a cover of a Judas Priest song titled \"Delivering The Goods\" from their 1978 album, Killing Machine.[303]\n\nOn February 27, 2023, Megadeth was joined by former guitarist Marty Friedman where they performed three songs at the Budokan in Japan. This marked Friedman's first performance with the band since 2000.[304] On June 23, former drummer Lee Rausch died at the age of 58.[305]\n\nOn September 6, 2023, it was announced that lead guitarist Kiko Loureiro would temporarily be leaving the North American portion of the tour and that he would be replaced by Teemu M\u00e4ntysaari.[306] On November 20, 2023, M\u00e4ntysaari joined Megadeth as their lead guitarist, after Loureiro announced he would be extending his absence from the band.[307] Loureiro said in a November 28, 2023 podcast interview that he was no longer in the band.[308] Loureiro explained his departure in a January 2024 interview with Guitar World, saying: \u201cI had two viable options: to be in Megadeth or not. I chose my personal life. No regrets\u201d.[309]\n\nIn a December 2023 interview on The SDR Show, Mustaine revealed his intention to release at least three more studio albums as Megadeth, with the first to be released in 2025: \"If it takes two years between an album \u2014 let's just say it does, if I'm able to put them out fast \u2014 it'll probably be three years, but let's just say it's two years. And I put an album out. We've still got about a year left on this one, at least. So that'll take us into '25.\"[310]\n\nMustaine has made numerous inflammatory statements in the press,[311] usually regarding issues with former Metallica bandmates. The feud stemmed from his ejection from the band, how it was conducted, and disagreements on songwriting credits.[312] Mustaine expressed his anger in the movie Metallica: Some Kind of Monster,[313] in a scene he later disapproved of as he felt he was mischaracterized, and that it did not represent the full extent of what happened during the meeting.[314]\n\nDuring a live performance of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" at a 1988 show in Antrim, Northern Ireland, Mustaine dedicated the song to \"the cause\" of \"giving Ireland back to the Irish!\"[nb 1] Before the final song, Mustaine said, \"This one's for the cause! Give Ireland back to the Irish!\"[76] This elicited a riot and fighting among the audience between Irish Nationalists, the majority of whom are Catholic, and the predominantly Protestant, British Unionists in attendance. The band had to travel in a bulletproof bus back to Dublin.[140] This incident served as inspiration for the song \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\".[316]\n\nControversial or misinterpreted lyrics have caused complications for the band. In 1988, MTV deemed that the song \"In My Darkest Hour\" encouraged suicide and banned the video.[317] The station banned the video for \"A Tout le Monde\" for the same reason, though Mustaine said the song was written from the perspective of a dying man saying his last words to his loved ones.[185] According to him, MTV considered the videos for \"Skin o' My Teeth\" and \"Symphony of Destruction\" a \"little bit too harsh\" and refused to play them.[318]\n\nDuring a world tour in 2001, the Malaysian government canceled the band's show in the nation's capital because the authorities had a negative perception of the group's image and music.[319] The government deemed the band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, as inappropriate and told the members that they would be arrested if they performed.[320] Dave Mustaine responded: \"I recognize what the Malaysian government is trying to do, and it is admirable of them trying to protect the young people in the country. But it just shows the degree of ignorance and apathy that the government has toward the problem.\"[142]\n\nIn 2003, after recovering from an arm injury that threatened to end his career, Mustaine became a born-again Christian.[321] Minor controversy was sparked by Mustaine's announcement that Megadeth would not play certain songs live due to his conversion.[322] In May 2005, Mustaine allegedly threatened to cancel shows in Greece and Israel with extreme metal bands Rotting Christ and Dissection due to the bands' anti-Christian beliefs. This caused the two bands to cancel appearances.[323]\n\nIn July 2004, former bassist Ellefson sued Mustaine for $18.5 million in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Ellefson alleged that Mustaine short-changed him on profits including tour merchandise and publishing royalties.[324] The suit was dismissed in 2005, and Mustaine filed a countersuit alleging that Ellefson had used the band's name in an advertisement for musical equipment;[325] the suit was settled out of court.[326]\n\nOn May 10, 2021, sexually explicit videos of Ellefson were posted on Twitter. The videos, reportedly recorded by a fan that Ellefson was in correspondence with, initially led to accusations of child grooming. However, Ellefson and the other party both denied the accusations, and the fan publicly claimed they were a consenting adult and the videos were unknowingly released by a third party. The Scottsdale Police Department (SPD) was contacted by Ellefson, who sought charges for revenge porn. Ellefson took a polygraph test to affirm his claims and presented police with a photo of the fan's driver's license to prove their age. He also shared screen shots of Snapchat and WhatsApp messages related to the allegations. Ellefson's partner admitted that she had shared the video with some friends but wasn't sure how it got leaked out to others. The SPD report states the fan \"was remorseful and agreed to send out a social media statement on...Instagram\" that they were \"a willing consenting adult during their mutual virtual sexual encounter.\" Ellefson then posted her statement and one of his own on May 10, asserting that the allegations of grooming were false. Ellefson stated he has not been extorted in any way, and he believes the videos of their consensual adult encounter were not intentionally leaked.[327] An official statement released the next day from Megadeth stated that the situation was being \"watched closely\".[288] Mustaine announced on May 24, 2021, that Ellefson was fired from the band.[328]\n\nTraditional heavy metal bands such as UFO, Black Sabbath, Budgie, Judas Priest,[329] new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) bands such as Raven,[330] Mot\u00f6rhead, Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, and Venom, and punk rock bands such as the Sex Pistols and Ramones had a significant influence on Megadeth's sound.[331] Hard rock bands such as AC/DC,[332] Queen,[333] Led Zeppelin,[334] and Rush,[335] as well as German acts like Scorpions[336] and Accept,[337] were also influential on the group's guitar style. Although the music has roots in punk,[338] university professor Jason Bivins wrote that Megadeth followed the basic blueprint of Mot\u00f6rhead and Iron Maiden. He described the style as a mix of \"the instrumental virtuosity of the NWOBHM with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk\", while also drawing lyrical inspiration from the horror-themed punk band Misfits.[339] Mustaine has also listed albums by the Beatles and David Bowie as recordings that influenced him.[340]\n\nMustaine is the band's primary songwriter. He develops songs starting with a particular riff that, with modifications, becomes the central part of the song.[341] He has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them.[342] Drummer Shawn Drover stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs over the years and that some recent material is based on those demo recordings.[343] Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and that making a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles.[344] The lyrics are usually written after the music is arranged.[345] Discussing the band's lyrics, Mustaine said that many of the themes are derived from literature, such as the novels of George Orwell.[346]\n\nThe music of Megadeth and its underground metal contemporaries from the 1980s featured harsh vocals, double bass drum patterns, staccato riffing, power chords, tremolo picking, and screeching lead guitar work; albums from this period were produced on low budgets.[347] After forming Megadeth, Mustaine followed the thrash metal style of his previous band, Metallica, with more emphasis on speed and intensity.[348] When asked to describe Megadeth's guitar style, Mustaine answered: \"When you go to a show and see a guitar player who just stands there, that's a guitar player. A thrash guitar player is a guy who plays like he wants to beat the guitar's guts out.\"[49] Most of the songs are recorded in standard guitar tuning as Mustaine believes it to provide a superior melody to alternative methods of tuning.[349]\nIn 2017, David Ellefson talked in an interview about how the band recently started to use a lower tuning saying: \"it's just natural with age, for singers it can be a struggle, so rather than quit, than not play, how do you work it around? Well, let's drop the guitars, let's find a way to work around it.\"[350]\n\nDuring the band's early days, Mustaine was the rhythm guitarist, while Chris Poland played lead. Poland performed only on Megadeth's first two albums at the time of the book's release; (he would go on to play on the 2004 album The System Has Failed); music journalists Pete Prown and Harvey P. Newquist credit him with making the music more colorful because of his jazz influences.[21] According to former Metal Maniacs editor Jeff Wagner, the band's songwriting techniques peaked with the fourth album, Rust in Peace, which he described as a \"flurry of precision and fluidity, making good on Megadeth's claim to being the world's state-of-the-art speed metal band\".[351] Musicologist Glenn Pillsbury stated the guitar work on the album was a mixture of Mustaine's \"controlled chaos\" and the \"technical brilliance\" of Marty Friedman.[80] Studio efforts released in the mid- and late 1990s featured songs with compact structures and less complicated riffing.[352]\n\nMegadeth's lyrics often focus on death, war, politics, and religion.[353] The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but occasionally deals with topics such as alienation and social problems.[93] The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism.[40][354] Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction.[84] During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and intimate relationships. For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said that he wanted to write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience.[355] The title of United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album.[356]\n\nHaving sold more than 50 million units worldwide, Megadeth is one of the few bands from the 1980s American underground metal scene to have achieved mass commercial success.[6] Along with contemporaries Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, Megadeth is regarded as one of the core founding groups of thrash metal.[357] These bands are often referred to as the \"big four\" of thrash metal,[358] responsible for the genre's development and popularization. Loudwire ranked Megadeth the third best thrash metal band of all time, praising the group's \"provoking lyrics and mind-warping virtuosity\".[359] CMJ New Music Report called the band's debut album a seminal release and a representative of \"the golden age of speed metal\".[360] Billboard called the band's second album Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? a \"landmark of the thrash movement\" whose lyrics it found still relevant.[361] MTV also recognized the band as an influential metal act, highlighting the technical aspect of the early albums.[362]\n\nMegadeth is considered one of the most musically influential groups that originated in the 1980s. As part of the early American thrash metal movement, the band's music was a direct influence on death metal.[347] Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris wrote that the mainstream success of Megadeth was one of the reasons for the expansion of extreme metal to countries where it had previously been unknown.[363] The band's sound and album artwork influenced a number of thrash metal bands in the 21st century,[364] including Toxic Holocaust and Warbringer.[343][365] According to Nielsen SoundScan, Megadeth has sold 9.2 million copies of its albums in the United States between 1991 and 2014.[366]\n\nCurrent members\n\nStudio albums\n\nClassic Rock Roll of Honour Awards:\n\nClio Awards:\n\nGenesis Awards:[367]\n\nGrammy Awards:\n\nLoudwire Music Awards:[368]\n\nMetal Hammer Golden Gods Awards:[369]\n\nRevolver Golden Gods Awards:[370]\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_heavy_metal", "content": "Other reasons this message may be displayed:\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Wave_of_British_Heavy_Metal", "content": "\n\nThe new wave of British heavy metal (commonly abbreviated as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in England in the mid-1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Editor Alan Lewis coined the term for an article by Geoff Barton in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper Sounds to describe the emergence of new heavy metal bands in the mid to late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music.\n\nAlthough encompassing diverse styles inherited from rock music, the music of the NWOBHM is best remembered for drawing on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes, such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock 'n' roll lifestyle.\n\nThe NWOBHM began as an underground phenomenon growing in parallel to punk and largely ignored by the media. It was only through the promotion of rock DJ Neal Kay and Sounds' campaigning that it reached the public consciousness and gained radio airplay, recognition and success in the UK. The movement involved mostly young, white, male and working-class musicians and fans, who suffered the hardships brought on by rising unemployment for years after the 1973\u201375 recession. As a reaction to their bleak reality, they created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other's company and their favourite loud music. The NWOBHM was heavily criticised for the excessive hype generated by local media in favour of mostly talentless musicians. Nonetheless, it generated a renewal in the genre of heavy metal music and furthered the progress of the heavy metal subculture, whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after the spread of the music to continental Europe, North America and Japan.\n\nBy some estimates, the movement spawned as many as a thousand heavy metal bands, but only a few survived the advent of MTV and the rise of the more commercial glam metal in the second half of the 1980s. Among them, Iron Maiden and Def Leppard became superstars, while Mot\u00f6rhead and Saxon also had considerable success. Other groups, such as Diamond Head, Venom and Raven, while reaching limited chart success, never achieved popularity of the above-mentioned bands, but were a major influence on the successful extreme metal subgenres of the mid/late 1980s and 1990s. Many bands from the NWOBHM reunited in the 2000s and remained active through live performances and new studio albums.\n\nIn the second half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and widespread poverty[1] as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession.[2] As a consequence of deindustrialisation, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth.[3] It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983.[4] The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots, including one in Brixton and another in Toxteth.[5] During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses.[6] The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in the economic depression that hit the country before and during the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.[6]\n\nThe desperation and the violent reaction of a generation robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977\u20131978, whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s.[7] These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing.[8] They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins and ripped clothes,[9] and considered musical prowess unimportant as long as the music was simple and loud.[3] However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, and peer companionship\u00a0\u2013 otherwise denied because of their unemployment.[10]\n\nThe UK was a cradle of the first wave of heavy metal, which was born at the end of the 1960s and flowered in the early 1970s.[11] Of the many British bands that came to prominence during that period, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple achieved worldwide success and critical acclaim.[12] The success of the music genre, usually called heavy rock at the time,[13] generated a community of UK fans with strong ties to psychedelia, hippie doctrines and biker subculture.[14] Each of these bands was in crisis in the mid-to-late 1970s: Led Zeppelin were plagued by discord and personal tragedies and had drastically reduced their activities,[15] Black Sabbath finally fired their charismatic but unreliable frontman Ozzy Osbourne,[16] and Deep Purple disbanded.[17] As a consequence, the whole movement lost much of its momentum and media interest, which were refocused on what British writer Malc Macmillan calls \"the more fashionable or lucrative markets of the day\" such as disco, glam, mod revival, new wave and electronic music.[18] Just like progressive rock acts and other mainstream music groups of the 1970s, heavy rock bands were viewed as\u00a0\u2013 in the words of journalist Garry Bushell\u00a0\u2013 \"lumbering dinosaurs\" by a music press infatuated with punk rock and new wave.[19] Some writers even declared the premature demise of heavy metal altogether.[20]\n\nThe crisis of British heavy rock giants left space for the rise of other rock bands in the mid-1970s,[21] including Queen,[22] Hawkwind,[23] Budgie,[24] Bad Company,[25] Status Quo[26] and Nazareth,[27] all of which had multiple chart entries in the UK and had conducted successful international tours.[28] The British chart results of the period show that there was still a vast audience for heavy metal in the country, and upcoming bands  UFO[29] and Judas Priest,[30] also had tangible success and media coverage in the late 1970s.[31] Foreign hard rock acts, such as Blue \u00d6yster Cult and Kiss from the US,[32][33] Rush from Canada,[34] Scorpions from West Germany,[35] Thin Lizzy from Ireland ,[36] and especially AC/DC from Australia,[37] climbed the British charts in the same period.[28]\n\nMot\u00f6rhead were founded in 1975 by already experienced musicians.[39] Their leader Ian \"Lemmy\" Kilmister was a former member of the space rock band Hawkwind,[40] Larry Wallis had played with Pink Fairies,[41] and Eddie Clarke had been a member of Curtis Knight's Zeus.[42] Their previous experience is one element which divides critics and fans over whether the band belongs to the new wave of British heavy metal.[43] Some believe that the band should be considered an inspiration for the movement, but not part of it, because they had signed recording contracts, toured the country, and had chart success before any NWOBHM band had stepped out of their local club scene.[43][44] Mot\u00f6rhead were also the only metal band of the period recording songs with veteran BBC radio DJ John Peel for his Peel Sessions programme[45] and the first to reach No.\u00a01 in the UK Albums Chart with the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith in June 1981.[44] Lemmy himself said, \"the NWOBHM\u00a0... didn't do us much good\", because Mot\u00f6rhead \"came along a bit too early for it\".[46]\n\nOther critics view Mot\u00f6rhead as the first significant exponent of the movement[47] and the first band to fully implement a crossover between punk rock and heavy metal.[48] Their fast music, the renunciation of technical virtuosity in favour of sheer loudness, and their uncompromising attitude were welcomed equally by punks and heavy metal fans.[48] Mot\u00f6rhead were supported by many NWOBHM bands on tour,[49] and they also shared the stage with Lemmy's friends' punk band The Damned.[50] Mot\u00f6rhead's musical style became very popular during the NWOBHM, making them a fundamental reference for the nascent movement and for musicians of various metal subgenres in the following decades.[51]\n\nThe NWOBHM involved both musicians and fans who were largely young, male and white and shared class origin, ethics, and aesthetic values.[52] American sociologist Deena Weinstein, in her book Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture, describes the rise and growth of the movement as the achievement of maturity for heavy metal, after its birth in the early 1970s and before branching out into various subgenres in the following years.[53] British heavy metal fans, commonly known as muthas,[54] metalheads,[55] or headbangers for the violent, rhythmic shaking of their heads in time to the music,[56] dismissed the simplistic image of rebellious youth inherited from the counterculture of the 1960s[57] and the psychedelic attachments characteristic of heavy rock in the 1970s,[58] updating the shared principles and codes of the heavy metal subculture[59] and definitely separating it from mainstream society.[60]\n\nTowards the end of the 1970s, British metalheads coalesced into a closed community of peers that exalted power and celebrated masculinity.[61] According to Deena Weinstein's analysis, their male camaraderie and the general absence of women in their ranks did not turn into machismo and misogyny.[62] In the same article, she wrote that British heavy metal: \"is not racist, despite its uniformly white performers, and its lyrics are devoid of racial references.\"[62] Another characteristic of the subculture was its latent homophobia, less violent, but not dissimilar to British skinheads' disposition;[63] in his book Running with the Devil: Power, Gender and Madness in Heavy Metal Music, Robert Walser calls it a \"collective affirmation of heterosexuality\",[64] and in a journal British sociologist John Clarke regards it as \"a reaction against the erosion of traditionally available stereotypes of masculinity\".[65]\n\nHeadbangers showed little interest in political and social problems, finding in each other's company, in the consumption of beer and in the music, the means to escape their bleak reality;[66] for this reason they were often accused of nihilism[67] or escapism.[68] In contrast with punks, they loved musicianship and made idols of virtuoso guitarists and vocalists,[69] viewing the live show as the full realisation of their status.[70] The fans were very loyal to the music, to each other and to the bands with whom they shared origins and from whom they required coherence with their values, authenticity and continuous accessibility.[71] To depart from this strict code meant being marked as a \"sell out\" or \"poseur\" and being somewhat excluded from the community.[72] The lyrics of the song \"Denim and Leather\" by Saxon reflect precisely the condition of British metalheads in those years of great enthusiasm.[73] Access to this male-dominated world for female musicians and fans was not easy, and only women who adapted to their male counterparts' standards and codes were accepted,[74] as attested by Girlschool[75] and Rock Goddess,[76] the only notable all-female heavy metal bands of that era.[77]\n\nThe music, philosophy and lifestyle of heavy metal bands and fans were often panned by both left-wing critics and conservative public opinion,[78] described as senseless, ridiculous to the limit of self-parody,[79] and even dangerous for the young generation.[80] The 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap addressed many idiosyncrasies of British metal bands, showing comic sides of that world which external observers would judge absurd.[81] Instead metal musicians regarded the movie's content as much too real.[82]\n\nThe dress code of the British headbangers reflected the newly found cohesion of the movement and recalled the look of 1960s rockers and American bikers.[83] The common elements were long hair and jeans, black or white T-shirts with band logos and cover art and leather jackets or denim vests adorned with patches.[56] Following the example of Judas Priest, elements of S&M fashion entered the metal wardrobe of the 1980s and it became typical to show off metallic studs and ornaments, or for metal musicians to wear spandex or leather trousers.[84] Elements of militaria, such as bullet belts and insignia, were also introduced at this time.[85] This style of dress quickly became the uniform of metalheads worldwide.[86]\n\nMost bands of the NWOBHM had the same look as their fans[83] and produced rock shows without special visual effects.[87] A notable exception was Iron Maiden, which created the grisly character Eddie the Head as a stage prop to enrich their performances very early in their career.[88] Other exceptions were Demon,[89] Cloven Hoof[90] and Samson,[91] which used various props, costumes and tricks in their shows, while Pagan Altar[92] and Venom became well known for their elaborate scenography inspired by shock rock and Satanism.[93]\n\nThe NWOBHM\u00a0\u2013 comprising bands with very different influences and styles[94]\u00a0\u2013 was promoted as both a movement and a distinct music genre only in its formative years during the mid-to-late 1970s.[18] Especially in those early years, what characterised the flood of new music was its raw sound, due in large part to low-budget productions, but also to the amateurish talents of many young bands.[95] Those young musicians were also linked by a shared inspiration from the works of the aforementioned successful heavy rock bands of the late 1960s and 1970s, and kept a sort of continuity with the earlier acts, whose music had temporarily gone out of fashion, but was still thriving underground.[96] However, the media of the 1980s and the promotional literature of record labels typically placed rock music that employed loud guitars, but was not classifiable as \"punk\" under the blanket term \"heavy metal\", subsuming the entire spectrum of NWOBHM bands within a single music genre.[97]\n\nFollowing a largely organic and uncalculated impulse, many of these new bands infused classic heavy metal with the immediacy of pub rock and the intensity of punk rock, implementing to various degrees the crossover of genres started by Mot\u00f6rhead;[98] in general they shunned ballads, de-emphasised harmonies and produced shorter songs with fast tempos and a very aggressive sound based on riffs and power chords, featuring vocals ranging from high pitched wails to gruff and low growls.[99] Iron Maiden,[100] Angel Witch,[101] Saxon,[102] Holocaust,[103] Tygers of Pan Tang,[104] Girlschool,[105] Tank[106] and More[107] are notable performers of this style, which bands such as Atomkraft,[108] Jaguar,[109] Raven[110] and Venom[111] stretched to produce even more extreme results. Critics consider this new approach to heavy metal the greatest musical accomplishment of the NWOBHM and an important evolutionary step for the genre.[112]\n\nA style more melodic and more akin to the hard rock of bands like Rainbow, Magnum, UFO, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake was equally represented during the NWOBHM.[114] The music of Def Leppard,[115] Praying Mantis,[116] White Spirit,[117] Demon,[89] Shy,[118] Gaskin,[119] Dedringer[120] and many others, contained hooks as much as riffs, often retained a closer link with blues rock,[121] included power ballads and featured keyboards, acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals. After the peak of the movement in 1981, this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound, which resembled that of mainstream American acts.[122] These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success.[123]\n\nThese two styles do not exhaust all of the musical influences found in the British heavy metal music of the early 1980s, because many bands were also inspired by progressive rock (Iron Maiden,[100] Diamond Head,[124] Blitzkrieg,[125] Demon,[89] Saracen,[126] Shiva,[127] Witchfynde[128]), boogie rock (Saxon,[129] Vardis,[130] Spider,[131] Le Griffe[132]) and glam rock (Girl,[133] Wrathchild[134]). Doom metal bands Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General were also part of the NWOBHM and their albums are considered among the best examples of that already established subgenre.[135]\n\nBritish writer John Tucker writes that NWOBHM bands were in general fuelled by their first experiences with adult life and \"their lyrics rolled everything into one big youthful fantasy\".[136] They usually avoided social and political themes in their lyrics,[137] or treated them in a shallow \"street-level\" way,[138] preferring topics from mythology, the occult, fantasy, science fiction and horror films.[139] Songs about romance and lust were rare,[140] but the frequent lyrics about male bonding and the rock lifestyle contain many sexist allusions.[141] Christian symbolism is often present in the lyrics and cover art,[142] as is the figure of Satan, used more as a shocking and macabre subject than as the antireligious device of 1990s' black metal subculture.[143]\n\nPopular heavy rock bands such as Thin Lizzy, UFO and Judas Priest were already major successes and playing international arenas,[145] when new heavy metal bands, composed of younger people, debuted in small venues in many cities in the UK.[8] The country's larger venues were usually reserved for chart-topping disco music, because their use as rock music clubs was considered less profitable.[146] Like most British bands in the past, the new groups spent their formative years playing live in clubs, pubs, dance halls and social circles for low wages; this training honed their skills, created a dedicated local fan base and enabled them to come in contact with managers and record label agents.[147]\n\nAngel Witch, Iron Maiden, Praying Mantis and Samson from London,[148] Son of a Bitch (later Saxon) from Barnsley,[129] Diamond Head from Stourbridge,[149] Marseille from Liverpool,[150] White Spirit from Hartlepool,[151] Witchfynde from Derbyshire,[152] Vardis from Wakefield,[153] Def Leppard from Sheffield,[154] Raven and Tygers of Pan Tang from around Newcastle,[155] and Holocaust from Edinburgh[156] were the most important metal bands founded between 1975 and 1977 that animated the club scene in their respective cities and towns.[157] The first bands of the newborn musical movement competed for space in venues with punk outfits, often causing clubs to specialise, presenting only punk or only rock and hard rock.[158] Differences in ideology, attitude and looks also caused heated rivalries between the two audiences.[159] What punk and NWOBHM musicians had in common was their \"do-it-yourself\" attitude toward the music business and the consequent practice of self-production and self-distribution of recorded material in the form of audio cassette demos, or privately pressed singles, aimed initially at local supporters.[5]\n\nIt also led to the birth and diffusion of small independent record labels, often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios, which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases.[160] Indie labels are considered important to the movement's evolution, because they removed the intrusion of corporate business which had hindered rock music in the late 1970s, giving local bands the chance to experiment with more extreme forms of music.[161]\n\nNWOBHM was a fiction, really, an invention of Geoff Barton and Sounds. It was a cunning ruse to boost circulation. Having said that, it did represent a lot of bands that were utterly ignored by the mainstream media. Because of that it became real and people got behind it.\n\nWhile British and international media covered punk intensively, the new grassroots metal movement remained underground until 1978, largely ignored by popular music magazines such as New Musical Express, The Face and Melody Maker and by radio stations.[4] News about the bands and music circulated by word-of-mouth and fanzines,[163] or through interested DJs, who travelled the country from club to club.[164] Neal Kay was one of those DJs; he started to work in 1975 at a disco club called The Bandwagon in Kingsbury, North West London, housed in the back-room of the Prince of Wales pub and equipped with a massive sound system.[165] He transformed his nights at The Bandwagon into The Heavy Metal Soundhouse, a spot specialising in hard rock and heavy metal music and a place to listen to albums of established acts and to demos of new bands,[166] which circulated among fans through cassette trading.[167] NWOBHM International Heroes' lead singer and songwriter,[168] Sean T. Wright, was a renowned cassette trader at the time.[169]\n\nBesides participating in air guitar competitions[170] and watching live shows,[171] the audience could also vote for Kay's selections.[172] The DJ made a weekly Heavy Metal Top 100 list of the most requested songs at The Soundhouse, by both newcomers and established bands and sent it to record shops and to the music journal Sounds, the only paper that showed interest in the developing scene.[172] Many young musicians realised that they were not alone in playing metal only through that weekly list, which included bands from all over the country.[173] At the time, Geoff Barton was a staffer at Sounds who wrote features on the new up-and-coming metal bands and was pivotal in directing the developing subculture of metalheads with his articles.[174] At the suggestion of his editor Alan Lewis, and in an attempt to find a common stylistic element in the bands' music, he used the term \"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\" for the first time in his review of a gig on the Metal Crusade tour featuring Angel Witch, Iron Maiden and Samson at The Music Machine in London on 8 May 1979.[175] The term soon became the identifier for the whole movement.[176]\n\nCompilation albums featuring bands from the nascent movement started to circulate, issued by Neat Records, Heavy Metal Records and Ebony Records, companies that became leaders in the independent metal label market during the 1980s.[177] The fresh outlet of Neal Kay's chart, the attention of Sounds and the many compilations issued by independent labels, focused the efforts of the new bands on producing demos and singles.[178] Iron Maiden's The Soundhouse Tapes is one of the best known collections of such demos.[179] As Barton recalled: \"There were hundreds of these bands. Maybe even thousands. Barely a day would go by without a clutch of new NWOBHM singles arriving in the Sounds office.\"[162]\n\nTommy Vance, a BBC radio host, took notice of the phenomenon and played singles by the new metal bands on his late night Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio\u00a01.[162] Along with John Peel's broadcast,[180] Vance's was the only mainstream radio show to feature songs from underground metal acts, many of whom were invited to play live at BBC studios under the supervision of long-time collaborator and producer, Tony Wilson.[181] Alice's Restaurant Rock Radio, a pirate FM radio station in London,[182] also championed the new bands on air and with their own \"roadshow\" in rock pubs and clubs.[183]\n\nDespite the transition of the young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in the UK, major record labels' A&R agents still did not recognise the rising new trend.[185] Thus, most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution.[186] Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts.[187] Saxon were the first to sign with an internationally distributed label, the French Carrere Records,[188] followed by Def Leppard with Phonogram in August 1979,[189] and Iron Maiden with EMI in December 1979.[190] In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album Metal for Muthas and a UK tour of the bands that had contributed to the compilation,[191] eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single)[192] and Ethel the Frog.[193]\n\nSounds gave Metal for Muthas a poor review, but the album was nevertheless a commercial success[194] and may have been instrumental in encouraging major labels to sign a few more bands.[195] A\u00a0II\u00a0Z,[196] Fist,[197] White Spirit[197] and Praying Mantis[198] were dropped after the release of their debut albums, while Tygers of Pan Tang,[197] Samson,[199] More,[107] Demon[200] and Girlschool[201] had more success and lasted longer on major labels' line-ups. The new releases by these bands were better produced and some of them, with the support of intensive tours in the UK and Europe,[202] obtained good chart results.[203] The best chart performances of that period were for Iron Maiden's debut album Iron Maiden and for Wheels of Steel by Saxon, which reached No.\u00a04 and No.\u00a05 on the UK Albums Chart respectively, while their singles \"Running Free\", \"Wheels of Steel\" and \"747 (Strangers in the Night)\" entered the UK Singles Chart Top 50.[204] The immediate consequence of that success was increased media coverage for metal bands,[205] which included appearances on the British music TV shows Top of the Pops[206] and The Old Grey Whistle Test.[207] The emergence of many new bands in the period between 1978 and 1980 was another remarkable effect of the promotion of the movement to a relevant national phenomenon.[5][a]\n\nThe momentum behind the NWOBHM also benefited already established bands, which reclaimed the spotlight with new and acclaimed releases.[223] Ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan returned to sing heavy metal with the album Mr. Universe in 1979[224] and was on the forefront of the British metal scene with his band Gillan in the following years.[225] His former Deep Purple bandmate Ritchie Blackmore also climbed the UK charts with his hard rock group Rainbow's releases Down to Earth (1979) and Difficult to Cure (1981).[226] Black Sabbath recovered and returned to success with the albums Heaven and Hell (1980) and Mob Rules (1981),[227] featuring the ex-Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio.[228] 1980 saw several other entries by hard rock and heavy metal bands in the top 10 of the British charts: MSG's first album peaked at No.\u00a08,[229] Whitesnake's Ready an' Willing at No.\u00a06,[230] Judas Priest's best-seller British Steel[30] and Mot\u00f6rhead's Ace of Spades at No.\u00a04,[44] while Back in Black by AC/DC reached number one.[37]\n\nAs proof of the successful revival of the British hard rock and metal scene, tours and gigs of old and new acts were sold out, both at home and in other European countries, where the movement had spread.[231] Groups arising from the NWOBHM were no longer precluded from world tours and were often chosen as opening acts for major bands in arenas and stadiums. Iron Maiden supported Kiss in Europe in 1980,[232] embarking on their first world tour as headliners in 1981,[233] as well as opening for Judas Priest and UFO in the US.[234] Def Leppard visited the US for the first time in 1980 for a three-month trek supporting Pat Travers, Judas Priest, Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Sammy Hagar.[235] Saxon opened for Judas Priest in Europe and for Rush and AC/DC in the US in 1981.[236] NWOBHM bands were already present on the roster of the famous Reading Festival in 1980,[237] and were quickly promoted to headliners for the 1981[238] and 1982 events.[239] The 1980 edition was also remarkable for the violent protests against Def Leppard, whose declared interest in the American market was received badly by British fans.[240] In addition to Reading, a new festival called Monsters of Rock was created in 1980 at Castle Donington, England, to showcase only hard rock and heavy metal acts.[241]\n\nThe NWOBHM eventually found space in newspapers and music magazines other than Sounds, as journalists caught up with the \"next big thing\" happening in the UK.[243] Melody Maker even published a weekly heavy metal chart based on record shop sales.[244] Sounds' publisher exploited his support of the movement to launch the first issue of Kerrang!, a colour magazine directed by Geoff Barton devoted exclusively to hard rock and heavy metal, in June 1981.[245] Kerrang! was an unexpected success and soon became the reference magazine for metalheads worldwide,[245] followed shortly by the American Circus and Hit Parader, the Dutch Aardschok, the German Metal Hammer and the British Metal Forces.[246] The attention of international media meant more record sales and more world tours for NWOBHM bands,[247] whose albums entered many foreign charts.[248] Their attempts to climb the British charts culminated in Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast topping the UK Albums Chart on 10 April 1982 and staying at number 1 for two weeks.[249] The album charted at number 33 in the US,[250] where the band acquired a reputation as Devil-worshippers due to the album cover's depiction of a hellish scene.[251]\n\nThe success of the music produced by the movement and its passage from underground phenomenon to mainstream genre, prompted its main promoter Geoff Barton to declare the NWOBHM finished in 1981.[252] He felt disappointed by the low quality of the new bands and frustrated by the ease with which record labels exploited enthusiasm for heavy metal.[253] Coincidentally, in the same year, the Bandwagon was closed and the Prince of Wales pub was subsequently demolished to build a restaurant.[254] Although the movement had lost some of its appeal for diehard fans, as evidenced by the increased popularity of American-influenced AOR releases on sales-based national polls,[255] it retained enough vitality to launch a second wave of bands, which rose from the underground and released their first albums in 1982 and 1983.[256][b]\n\nNWOBHM bands had been touring steadily in the United States, but had not yet received enough FM radio airplay there to make a significant impression on American charts.[263] Def Leppard remedied that, releasing Pyromania at the beginning of 1983, an album with a more melodic and FM-friendly approach in comparison with the more aggressive sound of their earlier music.[264] The band's goal of reaching a wider international audience, which included many female fans, was attained completely in the US,[265] where Pyromania peaked at No.\u00a02 on the Billboard 200 chart behind Michael Jackson's Thriller.[266] Thanks to a string of hit singles and the heavy rotation of their music videos on the recently launched MTV, the album had sold more than six millions copies in the US by 1984 and made Def Leppard superstars.[267] The overwhelming international success of Pyromania induced both American and British bands to follow Def Leppard's example,[268] giving a decisive boost to the more commercial and melodic glam metal and heralding the end of the NWOBHM.[269]\n\nThe UK had been a home for music video pioneers. When the music video cable channel MTV started broadcasting in 1982, the importance of videos abruptly grew, changing the video from an occasional promotional tool to an indispensable means of reaching an audience.[270] MTV filled its programmes with many hard rock and heavy metal videos,[271] but these were too expensive for bands who either had no recording contract or had signed to small, independent labels.[272] Moreover, music videos exalted the visual appeal of a band, an area where some British metal groups were deficient.[273] So the NWOBHM suffered the same decline as other musical phenomena that were based on low-budget productions and an underground following.[274] Many of its leaders, such as Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang, Angel Witch and Samson, were unable to follow up on their initial success; their attempts to update their look and sound to match new expectations of the wider audience not only failed, but also alienated their original fans.[275]\n\nBy the mid-1980s, glam metal, which often emphasized a band's appearance and featured lyrics about love and sex, quickly replaced other styles of metal in the tastes of many British rock fans; this sub-genre emanating from Hollywood's Sunset Strip was spearheaded already in the late 1970s by Van Halen and followed by bands such as M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce, Quiet Riot, Dokken, Great White, Ratt and W.A.S.P.[269] New Jersey act Bon Jovi and the Swedish Europe, thanks to their successful fusion of hard rock and romantic pop,[276] also became very popular in the UK, with the former even headlining the 1987 Monsters of Rock Festival.[277] Record companies latched on to the more polished glam metal subgenre over the NWOBHM bands, which maintained a fan base elsewhere in Europe, but found themselves crowded out of the UK and US markets by the success of these American groups.[269] While the attention devoted to the NWOBHM bands waned, a new succession of far less mainstream metal subgenres began to emerge and attract many British metalheads.[278] Power metal and thrash metal, both stemming from the NWOBHM and maintaining much of its ethos,[279] were gaining critical acclaim and commercial success in the second half of the 1980s with their even faster and heavier sound.[280] Bands such as Helloween,[281] Savatage,[282] Metallica,[283] Slayer,[284] Megadeth,[285] and Anthrax captured much of the market share of those metalheads who were not content with the sound or style of more mainstream, pop-oriented metal bands.[286]\n\nThe N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia by Malc Macmillan lists more than 500 recording bands established in the decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement.[244][c] Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club scene, or recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self-produced singles.[291] The record labels' lack of interest, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing by the end of the decade.[292] A few of the best known groups, such as Praying Mantis in Japan and Saxon, Demon and Tokyo Blade in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets.[293] Some others, namely Raven,[294] Girlschool[295] and Grim Reaper,[296] tried to break through in the US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time,[297] even after adopting a more progressive style.[100] Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound.[298]\n\nThe widespread popularity of the Internet in the late 1990s/early 2000s helped NWOBHM fans and musicians to reconnect and rekindle their shared enthusiasm.[299] The NWOBHM experienced a minor underground revival, highlighted by the good sales of old vinyl and collectibles and by the demand for new performances.[300] Statements of appreciation by metal bands of the 1990s,[301] the success of tribute bands, the re-issues of old albums and the production of new thoroughly edited compilations, attracted the media's attention and encouraged many of the original groups to reunite for festival appearances and tours.[302] According to Macmillan and AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia, probably the most important of those compilation albums was New Wave of British Heavy Metal '79 Revisited, compiled by Metallica's drummer Lars Ulrich and former Sounds and Kerrang! journalist Geoff Barton.[303] It was released in 1990 as a double CD, featuring bands as obscure as Hollow Ground right through to the major acts of the era.[304]\n\nA new publication called Classic Rock, featuring Barton and many of the writers from Kerrang!'s first run, championed the NWOBHM revival and continues to focus much of its attention on rock acts from the 1980s.[305] Starting in the 2000s, many reunited bands recorded new albums and revisited their original styles, abandoned in the second half of the 1980s.[306] Their presence, at metal festivals and on the international rock club circuit, has been constant ever since.[162]\n\nThe NWOBHM triggered a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre, but took on heavy criticism for the excessive local media hype surrounding a legion of typically mediocre musicians.[308] Detractors think that, unlike heavy metal of the preceding decades, their music was unoriginal[309] and included no classic rock recordings.[308] Nevertheless, these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across the Western world would later emulate and expand.[310] The collision of styles that characterised the NWOBHM is now seen as key to the diversification of heavy metal in the second half of the 1980s into various subgenres that came to the fore in the 1990s.[311] The stardom of Def Leppard in the US provided a catalyst for the growth of glam metal,[312] just as bands like Angel Witch, Witchfynde, Cloven Hoof and especially Venom[d] generated the music, lyrics, cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in Europe and America.[313] Mot\u00f6rhead, Iron Maiden, Raven, Tank, Venom and several minor groups are viewed as precursors of speed metal and thrash metal, two subgenres which carried forward the crossover with punk, incorporating elements of hardcore while amplifying volume, velocity and aggressive tone.[314]\n\nStarting around 1982, distant points such as North America,[315] West Germany,[316] and Brazil[317] each became the locus of its own distinctive thrash metal scenes\u00a0\u2013 East Coast and Bay Area, Teutonic, and Brazilian thrash metal. Their debt to the NWOBHM was acknowledged for example by Metallica's Lars Ulrich, an active fan and avid collector of NWOBHM recordings and memorabilia.[318] Under his influence, the setlists of Metallica's early shows were filled with covers of British metal groups.[319] The sound of the NWOBHM even \"cross-pollinated\" a subgenre of punk, as UK 82 street punk bands like Discharge blended punk music with elements of metal.[320] The birth of speed metal in the early 1980s was also pivotal for the evolution of power metal in the latter half of the decade,[321] as exemplified by Helloween from Germany,[322] and Manowar,[323] Savatage,[282] and Virgin Steele[324] from the US.\n\nSince the beginning of the NWOBHM, North American bands like Anvil,[326] Riot,[326] Twisted Sister,[327] Manowar,[326] Virgin Steele,[328] The Rods,[329] Hellion,[330] Cirith Ungol,[331] and Exciter[332] had a continuous exchange with the other side of the Atlantic, where their music was appreciated by British metalheads.[333] In this climate of reciprocity, Manowar and Virgin Steele initially signed with the British indie label Music for Nations,[334] while Twisted Sister recorded their first two albums in London.[327]\n\nThe sound of Japanese bands Earthshaker, Loudness, Anthem and other minor groups was also influenced by the NWOBHM, whose British sound engineers were used for their early albums.[335] The Japanese band Bow Wow even transferred to England to be part of the British metal scene.[336] Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, Yugoslavia and Mexico promptly welcomed the new British bands and spawned imitators almost immediately.[333] Acts like Accept, Grave Digger, Sinner and Warlock from Germany,[337] E.\u00a0F. Band from Sweden,[338] Mercyful Fate from Denmark,[339] Killer and Ostrogoth from Belgium,[340] Picture and Bodine from the Netherlands,[341] Trust, Sortil\u00e8ge and Nightmare from France,[342] Bar\u00f3n Rojo, Ob\u00fas and \u00c1ngeles del Infierno from Spain,[343] Gordi, Pomaran\u010da, Divlje Jagode, and Warriors from Yugoslavia,[344] Luzbel from Mexico[345] or Aria from the Soviet Union[346] formed between 1978 and the beginning of the new decade and were heavily influenced by the sound of the NWOBHM. Many of these bands signed with the Dutch Roadrunner Records or with the Belgian Mausoleum Records, independent labels that also published recordings of British NWOBHM acts.[347]\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Puppets", "content": "\n\nMaster of Puppets is the third studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released on March 3, 1986, by Elektra Records.[2] Recorded in Copenhagen, Denmark, at Sweet Silence Studios with producer Flemming Rasmussen, it is the band's final album to feature bassist Cliff Burton. While touring in support of Master of Puppets, he died on September 27, 1986 after the band's tour bus was involved in an accident in D\u00f6rarp, Sweden.\n\nThe album's artwork, designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam, depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a clouded, blood-red sky, with a fiery orange glow on the horizon. The album is the band\u2019s most recent to date to feature a runtime of under an hour. Instead of releasing a single or video in advance of the album's release, Metallica embarked on a five-month American tour in support of Ozzy Osbourne. The European leg was canceled after Burton's death in September 1986, and the band returned home to audition a new bassist.\n\nMaster of Puppets peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 and received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its music and political lyrics. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential metal albums of all time, and is credited with consolidating the American thrash metal scene. It was certified six times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2003 for shipping six million copies in the United States, and was later certified six times platinum by Music Canada and platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In 2015, Master of Puppets became the first metal recording to be selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" In 2023, guitarist Kirk Hammett ranked Master of Puppets as his favorite Metallica album.[3]\n\nMetallica's 1983 debut Kill 'Em All laid the foundation for thrash metal with its aggressive musicianship and vitriolic lyrics. The album revitalized the American underground scene, and inspired similar records by contemporaries.[4] The band's second album Ride the Lightning extended the limits of the genre with its more sophisticated songwriting and improved production. The album caught the attention of Elektra Records representative Michael Alago, who signed the group to an eight-album deal in the fall of 1984.[5] Elektra reissued Ride the Lightning on November 19, and the band began touring larger venues and festivals throughout 1985. After parting with manager Jon Zazula, Metallica hired Q Prime executives Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch. During the summer, the band played the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, alongside Bon Jovi and Ratt to an audience of 70,000.[6]\n\nMetallica was motivated to make an album that would impress critics and fans, and began writing new material in mid-1985. Lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich were the main songwriters on the album, already titled Master of Puppets. The two developed ideas at a garage in El Cerrito, California, before inviting bassist Cliff Burton and guitarist Kirk Hammett for rehearsals.[7] Hetfield and Ulrich described the songwriting process as starting with \"guitar riffs, assembled and reassembled until they start to sound like a song\". After that, the band came up with a song title and topic, and Hetfield wrote lyrics to match the title.[8] Master of Puppets is Metallica's first album not to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine claimed he had co-written \"Leper Messiah\", based on an old song called \"The Hills Ran Red\". The band denied this, but stated that one section incorporated Mustaine's ideas.[9]\n\nWhen I saw two kids who worked there in London wearing T-shirts of a local San Francisco band, I knew I was onto something. When I heard their record, I knew they were the one band that could sell to both mainstream and underground metal audiences.\n\nThe band was not satisfied with the acoustics of the American studios they considered, and decided to record in Ulrich's native Denmark.[11] Ulrich took drum lessons, and Hammett worked with Joe Satriani to learn how to record more efficiently.[7] Ulrich was in talks with Rush's bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee to produce the album, but the collaboration never materialized because of uncoordinated schedules.[12] Metallica recorded the album with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark, from September 1 to December 27, 1985.[1] The writing of all the songs except \"Orion\" and \"The Thing That Should Not Be\" was completed before the band's arrival in Copenhagen.[9] Rasmussen stated that the band brought well-prepared demos of the songs, and only slight changes were made to the compositions in the studio.[13] The recording took longer than the previous album because Metallica had developed a sense of perfectionism and had higher ambitions.[11]\n\nMetallica eschewed the slick production and synthesizers of contemporary hard rock and glam metal albums. With a reputation for drinking, the band stayed sober on recording days.[9] Hammett recalled that the group was \"just making another album\" at the time and \"had no idea that the record would have such a range of influence that it went on to have\". He also said that the group was \"definitely peaking\" at the time and that the album had \"the sound of a band really gelling, really learning how to work well together.\"[14]\n\nRasmussen and Metallica did not manage to complete the mixtapes as planned. Instead, the multitrack recordings were sent in January 1986 to Michael Wagener, who finished the album's mixing.[7] The cover was designed by Metallica and Peter Mensch and painted by Don Brautigam. It depicts a cemetery field of white crosses tethered to strings, manipulated by a pair of hands in a blood-red sky. Ulrich explained that the artwork summarized the lyrical content of the album\u2014people being subconsciously manipulated.[15] The original artwork was sold at Rockefeller Plaza, New York City for $28,000 in 2008.[16] The band mocked the warning stickers promoted by the PMRC with a facetious Parental Advisory label on the cover: \"The only track you probably won't want to play is 'Damage, Inc.' due to multiple use of the infamous 'F' word. Otherwise, there aren't any 'shits', 'fucks', 'pisses', 'cunts', 'motherfuckers', or 'cocksuckers' anywhere on this record\".[11]\n\nThe album was recorded with the following equipment: Hammett's guitars were a 1974 Gibson Flying V, a Jackson Randy Rhoads, and a Fernandes Stratocaster copy;[17] Hetfield used a Jackson King V played through a Mesa Boogie Mark IIC+ amplifier modified as a pre-amp;[18] Burton played an Aria Pro II SB1000 through Mesa Boogie amplifier heads and cabinets;[19] Ulrich played Tama drum equipment, and borrowed a rare Ludwig Black Beauty snare drum from Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen.[20]\n\nMaster of Puppets features dynamic music and thick arrangements. Metallica delivered a more refined approach and performance compared to the previous two albums, with multilayered songs and technical dexterity.[21] This album and its predecessor Ride the Lightning follow a similar track sequencing: both open with an up-tempo song with an acoustic intro, followed by a lengthy title track, and a fourth track with ballad qualities.[9] Although both albums are similarly structured, the musicianship on Master of Puppets is more powerful and epic in scope, with tight rhythms and delicate guitar solos.[22] According to music writer Joel McIver, Master of Puppets introduced a new level of heaviness and complexity in thrash metal, displaying atmospheric and precisely executed songs. Hetfield's vocals had matured from the hoarse shouting of the first two albums to a deeper, in-control, yet aggressive style.[11]\n\nThe songs explore themes such as control and the abuse of power. The lyrics describe the consequences of alienation, oppression, and feelings of powerlessness. Author Ryan Moore thought the lyrics depicted \"ominous yet unnamed forces of power wielding total control over helpless human subjects\".[23] The lyrics were considered perceptive and harrowing, and were praised for being honest and socially conscious by writer Brock Helander.[24] Referring to the epic proportions of the songs, BBC Music's Eamonn Stack stated that \"at this stage in their careers Metallica weren't even doing songs, they were telling stories\".[25] The compositions and arrangements benefited from bassist Cliff Burton's classical training and understanding of harmony.[11]\n\n\"Battery\" refers to angry violence, as in the term \"assault and battery\". Some critics contended that the title actually refers to an artillery battery, and interpreted it as \"Hetfield [singing] of a war tactic as the aggressor\" personifying destruction. The song begins with bass-heavy acoustic guitars that build upon multitracked layers until they are joined by a sonic wall of distorted electric guitars.[11] It then breaks into fast, aggressive riffing, featuring off-beat rhythms and heavily distorted minor dyads where root-fifth power chords might be expected. Hetfield improvised the riff while relaxing in London.[17]\n\n\"Master of Puppets\" consists of several riffs with odd meters and a cleanly picked middle section with melodic solo. The song shares a similar structure with \"The Four Horsemen\" from the band's first album: two verse-chorus sets lead to a lengthy interlude to another verse-chorus set.[26] The opening and pre-verse sections feature fast downpicked chromatic riffing at around 212 beats per minute in mostly 44 time.[17] Every fourth bar of each verse and the outro is cut short by more than a beat; the time signature of these bars is often idealistically analyzed as being 58,[26] but it is performed with a delay after the third beat, making it closer to 2132 (4+4+5+4+432).[27] A lengthy interlude follows the second chorus, beginning with a clean, arpeggiated section over which Hetfield contributes a melodic solo; the riffing becomes distorted and progressively more heavy and Hammett provides a more virtuosic solo before the song eventually returns to the main verse.[26] A riff from \"Andy Warhol\" by David Bowie (at 0:48) is quoted in the track (at 6:19). It is an homage made by Burton and Hammett to whom Bowie was a huge influence.[28] The song closes with a fade-out of sinister laughter. The lyrical theme is cocaine addiction.[29]\n\n\"The Thing That Should Not Be\" was inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos created by famed horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, with notable direct references to The Shadow over Innsmouth[30] and to Cthulhu himself, who is the subject matter of the song's chorus. It is considered the heaviest track on the album, with the main riff emulating a beast dragging itself into the sea. The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are down-tuned, creating slow and moody ambience.[17]\n\n\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution.[30] The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures.[17] The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \"Fade to Black\" on Ride the Lightning and would follow with \"One\" on ...And Justice for All and later \"The Day That Never Comes\" on Death Magnetic.[26]\n\n\"Disposable Heroes\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record.[33] The guitar passage at the end of each verse was Hammett's imitation of the sort of music he found in war films.[9]\n\nThe syncopated riffing of \"Leper Messiah\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told.[32] The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \"Lie!\".[26] The title derives from the lyrics to the David Bowie song \"Ziggy Stardust\".[9]\n\n\"Orion\" is a multipart instrumental highlighting Burton's bass playing. It opens with a fade-in bass section, heavily processed to resemble an orchestra. It continues with mid-tempo riffing, followed by a bass riff at half-tempo. The tempo accelerates during the latter part, and ends with music fading out.[19] Burton arranged the middle section, which features its moody bass line and multipart guitar harmonies.[9]\n\n\"Damage, Inc.\" rants about senseless violence and reprisal at an unspecified target.[11] It starts with a series of reversed bass chords based on the chorale prelude of Bach's \"Come, Sweet Death\".[9] The song then jumps into a rapid rhythm with a pedal-point riff in E that Hammett says was influenced by Deep Purple.[17]\n\nMaster of Puppets was hailed as a masterpiece by critics outside of the thrash metal audience and cited by some as the genre's greatest album.[21] In a contemporary review, Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone asserted that the band had redefined heavy metal with the technical skill and subtlety showcased on the album, which he described as \"the sound of global paranoia\".[43] Kerrang! wrote that Master of Puppets \"finally put Metallica into the big leagues where they belong\".[7] Editor Tom King said Metallica was at an \"incredible song-writing peak\" during the recording sessions, partially because Burton contributed to the songwriting.[29] By contrast, Spin magazine's Judge I-Rankin was disappointed with the album and said, although the production is exceptional and Metallica's experimentation is commendable, it eschews the less \"intellectual\" approach of Kill 'Em All for a MDC-inspired direction that is inconsistent.[33]\n\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic's Steve Huey viewed Master of Puppets as Metallica's best album and remarked that, although it was not as unexpected as Ride the Lightning, it is a more musically and thematically consistent album.[21] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said the songs were the band's most intense at that point, and veer toward \"the progressive tendency of Rush.\"[35] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters praised the production as \"a metal version of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound\" and believed none of Metallica's subsequent albums could match its passionate and intense musical quality.[30] BBC Music's Eamonn Stack called the album \"hard, fast, rock with substance\" and likened the songs to stories of \"biblical proportions\".[25] Canadian journalist Martin Popoff compared the album to Ride the Lightning and found Master of Puppets not a remake, though similar in \"awesome power and effect\".[37] Robert Christgau was more critical. Writing in Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s (1990), he said the band's energy and political motivations are respectable, but the music evokes clich\u00e9d images of \"revolutionary heroes\" who are \"male chauvinists too inexperienced to know better\".[36]\n\nReleased on March 3, 1986, the album had a 72-week run on the Billboard 200 album charts and earned the band its first gold certification.[6] The album debuted on March 29 at number 128[44] and peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200 chart.[8] Billboard reported that 300,000 copies were sold in its first three weeks.[45] More than 500,000 copies were sold in its first year, even with virtually no radio airplay and no music videos.[46] In 2003, Master of Puppets was certified 6\u00d7 platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with six million copies shipped in the United States. Between the beginning of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991 and 2023, 7,980,000 copies were sold.[47] The album was less successful on an international level, despite entering the top 5 on the Finnish and the top 40 on the German and Swiss album charts in its inaugural year.[48] In 2004, it peaked within the top 15 in Sweden. In 2008, the album reached the top 40 on the Australian and Norwegian album charts.[49] It received 6\u00d7 platinum certification from Music Canada and a gold certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 600,000 and 100,000 copies, respectively.[50][51]\n\nBassist Robert Trujillo cited Master of Puppets as his favorite album, \"I feel Master of Puppets has a lot of everything. It's got instrumentals, it's got great segues, great riffs. It's got one of my favorite songs ever by Metallica, and that song is \"Disposable Heroes\". So any time I can hear that particular song, count me in. \"Battery\" is an amazing song. So it's just got everything that I love about Metallica.\"[52]\n\nMaster of Puppets has appeared in several publications' best album lists. It was ranked number 167 on the list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time,[53] maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list,[54] and upgrading to number 97 in a 2020 revised list.[55] The magazine would also later rank it second on its 2017 list of \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\", behind Black Sabbath's Paranoid.[56] Time included the album in its list of the 100 best albums of all time. According to the magazine's Josh Tyrangiel, Master of Puppets reinforced the velocity of playing in heavy metal and diminished some of its clich\u00e9s.[57] Slant Magazine placed the album at number 90 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s, saying Master of Puppets is Metallica's best and most sincere recording.[58] The album is featured in Robert Dimery's book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[59] IGN named Master of Puppets the best heavy metal album of all time. The website stated it was Metallica's best because it \"built upon and perfected everything they had experimented with prior\" and that \"all the pieces come together in glorious cohesion\".[60] Music journalist Martin Popoff also ranked it the best heavy metal album.[61] Rock Hard ranked the album as the second greatest rock and metal album of all time, behind AC/DC's Back in Black.[62] The album was voted the fourth greatest guitar album of all time by Guitar World in 2006,[63] and the title track ranked number 61 on the magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitar solos.[64] Total Guitar ranked the main riff of the title track at number 7 among the top 20 guitar riffs.[65] The April 2006 edition of Kerrang! was dedicated to the album and gave away to readers the cover album Master of Puppets: Remastered.[66]\n\nMaster of Puppets became thrash metal's first platinum album and by the early 1990s thrash metal successfully challenged and redefined the mainstream of heavy metal. Metallica and a few other bands headlined arena concerts and appeared regularly on MTV, although radio play remained incommensurate with their popularity.[67] Master of Puppets is widely accepted as the genre's most accomplished album, and paved the way for subsequent development.[68] The album, in the words of writer Christopher Knowles, \"ripped Metallica away from the underground and put them atop the metal mountain\".[69] David Hayter from Guitar Planet recognized the album as one of the most influential records ever made and a benchmark by which other metal albums should be judged.[22] MTV's Kyle Anderson had similar thoughts, saying that 25 years after its release the album remained a \"stone cold classic\".[70] Carlos Ramirez from Noisecreep believes that Master of Puppets stands as one of the most representative albums of its genre.[71]\n\nThe year 1986 is seen as a pinnacle year for thrash metal in which the genre broke out of the underground due to albums such as Megadeth's Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? and Slayer's Reign in Blood. Anthrax released Among the Living in 1987, and by the end of the year these bands, alongside Metallica, were being called the \"Big Four\" of thrash metal.[11] Master of Puppets frequently tops critic and fan polls of favorite thrash metal albums. Histories of the band tend to position Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice for All as a trilogy over the course of which the band's music progressively matured and became more sophisticated.[26] In 2015, the album was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry.[72]\n\nKerrang! released a tribute album titled Master of Puppets: Remastered with the April 8, 2006, edition of the magazine to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Master of Puppets. The album featured cover versions of Metallica songs by Machine Head, Bullet for My Valentine, Chimaira, Mastodon, Mendeed, and Trivium\u2014all of which are influenced by Metallica.\n\nThe title track was also featured in the fourth season finale of the Netflix series Stranger Things, as the character Eddie Munson plays the song in the Upside Down dimension to draw the dimension's monsters away from his friends.[73] Kelly McClure of Salon compares the song's newfound popularity to Kate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill\", another song featured in the show's fourth season.[74] The song's appearance on Stranger Things saw the song resurging on Spotify's charts, behind \"Running Up That Hill\", and the band stated on social media that \"It\u2019s an incredible honor to be such a big part of Eddie\u2019s journey and to once again be keeping company with all of the amazing artists featured in the show.\"[75]\n\nMetallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album.[9] The Damage, Inc. Tour began in March 1986, and the band spent March to August touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences.[6] During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as mockery.  Ulrich, however, stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour.[10] Metallica was noted by the media for their excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \"Alcoholica\".[5] The band members occasionally even wore satirical T-shirts reading \"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\".[10]\n\nThe band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica.\"[76] Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.[77] Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and guitar technician John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates.[78]\n\nThe European leg of the tour commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. The morning after a performance on September 26 in Stockholm, the band's bus rolled off the road, and Burton was thrown through a window and killed instantly. The driver claimed he hit a patch of black ice, but others believed he was either drunk or fell asleep at the wheel.  The driver was charged with manslaughter but was not convicted.[9] The band returned to San Francisco and hired Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted to replace Burton.[79] Many of the songs that appeared on the band's next album, ...And Justice for All, were composed during Burton's career with the band.[19]\n\nAll of the songs have been performed live, and some became permanent setlist features.[80] Four tracks were featured on the nine-song set list for the album's promotional tour: \"Battery\" as opener, \"Master of Puppets\", \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\", and \"Damage, Inc.\"[11] The title track, which was issued as a single in France,[81] became a live staple and the most-played Metallica song. Loudwire's Chad Childers characterized the band's performance as \"furious\" and the song as the set's highlight.[82] Rolling Stone described the live performance as \"a classic in all its eight-minute glory\".[83] While filming its 3D movie Metallica: Through the Never (2013) at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, crosses were rising from the stage during the song, reminiscent of the album's cover art.[84]\n\n\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\" is the second-most performed song from the album.[85] The live performance is often accompanied by lasers, pyrotechnical effects and film screens.[84] \"Battery\" is usually played at the beginning of the setlist or during the encore, accompanied by lasers and flame plumes.[86] \"Disposable Heroes\" is featured in the video album Orgullo, Pasi\u00f3n, y Gloria: Tres Noches en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (2009) filmed in Mexico City, in which the song was played on the second of three nights at the Foro Sol.[87] \"Orion\" is the least-performed song from the album.[85] Its first live performance was during the Escape from the Studio '06 tour, when the band performed the album in its entirety, honoring the 20th anniversary of its release.[88] The band performed the album in the middle of the set.[89] \"Battery\", \"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\", \"Damage, Inc.\" and the full-length \"Master of Puppets\" were revived for the band's concerts in 1997 and 1998, after having been retired for a number of years.[26]\n\nAll lyrics written by James Hetfield. \nThe bonus tracks on the digital re-release were recorded live at the Seattle Coliseum, Seattle, Washington, on August 29 and 30, 1989, and also appeared on the live album Live Shit: Binge & Purge (1993).\n\nIn 2017, the album was remastered and reissued in a limited edition deluxe box set with an expanded track listing and bonus content. The deluxe edition set includes the original album on vinyl and CD, with two additional vinyl records containing a live recording from Chicago; nine CDs of interviews, rough mixes, demo recordings, outtakes, and live recordings recorded from 1985 to 1987; a cassette of a fan recording of Metallica's September 1986 live concert in Stockholm, which was Cliff Burton's final performance before his death; and two DVDs of interviews and live recordings recorded in 1986.[91]\n\nCredits are adapted from the album's liner notes.[92]\n\nMetallica\n\nProduction\n\nArtwork\n\nDigital reissue bonus tracks\n\n\n\n* Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\u2021 Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Number_of_the_Beast", "content": "The number of the beast, 666 in most manuscripts, is associated with the Beast of Revelation in the Book of Revelation in the Bible.\n\nNumber of the Beast also may refer to:\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_(album)", "content": "\n\nParanoid is the second studio album by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, released on 18 September 1970, by Vertigo Records in the United Kingdom and on 7 January 1971, by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The album contains several of the band's signature songs, including \"Iron Man\", \"War Pigs\" and the title track, which was the band's only Top 20 hit, reaching number 4 on the UK charts.\n\nParanoid is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time, often cited as a key influence for the development of the genre as well as one of its earliest albums.[4][5][6] Paranoid was ranked number one on Rolling Stone\u2018s list of the \"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\" in 2017 and number 139 on its list of the \u201c500 Greatest Albums of All Time\u201d in 2020.  Paranoid was the band's only album to top the UK Albums Chart until the release of 13 in 2013.\n\nIn an effort to capitalise on the recent UK chart success of their eponymous debut album, Black Sabbath returned to the studio with producer Rodger Bain in June 1970, just four months after the album was released. Paranoid was recorded at Regent Sound Studios and Island Studios in London, England.[7]\n\nThe album's title track was written as an afterthought. As drummer Bill Ward explains: \"We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony [Iommi] just played the guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom.\"[8] In the liner notes to the 1998 live album Reunion, bassist Geezer Butler recounts to Phil Alexander that they wrote the song \"in five minutes, then I sat down and wrote the lyrics as quickly as I could. It was all done in about two hours.\" According to Alexander, \"Paranoid\" \"crystallized the band's writing process, with Iommi initiating the ideas with his charred riffs, Ozzy [Osbourne] working on a melody, Geezer providing drive and the majority of the lyrics, and Bill Ward locking into a set of often pounding rhythms beneath Butler's bass rumble.\" The single was released in August 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit.[9]\n\nMost of the songs on Paranoid evolved during onstage improvisational jams. In the Classic Albums documentary on the making of Paranoid, guitarist Tony Iommi recalls that \"War Pigs\" came from \"one of the clubs\" with Butler adding, \"During the song \"Warning\" we used to jam that out and that particular night when we were jamming it out Tony just went da-dum!\" In the same documentary, Iommi demonstrates his approach to the guitar solo in the song, explaining that \"I always tried to keep the bottom string ringing so it fills it out nicely.\" On \"Planet Caravan\", Osbourne sings through a Leslie speaker, with the singer telling Mojo in 2010, \"Then Rodger Bain used an oscillator on it \u2013 whatever that is. It looks like a fridge with a knob on.\"\n\nThe album's opening track \"War Pigs\" was originally intended to be called \"Walpurgis\".[10] It was then changed to \"War Pigs\", which the band intended to name the album until it was changed to Paranoid after the record company became convinced that the song of the same name had potential as a single.[10] Butler explained his intentions to Classic Albums: \"I wanted to write a song called 'Walpurgis' \u2013 you know, the Satanic version of Christmas \u2013 write it about that Satan isn't a spiritual thing, it's warmongers. That's who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them. We sent it off to the record company and they said, 'No, we're not going to call it that. Too Satanic!' So I changed it to 'War Pigs'.\" In his autobiography I Am Ozzy, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne recalls, \"It was originally going to be called 'Walpurgis'\u00a0... which was a term for a black magic wedding or something. Then we changed it to 'War Pigs', and Geezer came up with these heavy duty lyrics about death and destruction. No wonder we never got any chicks at our gigs. Geezer just wasn't interested in your average 'I love you' pop song\u00a0... Geezer also liked to put a lot of topical stuff, like Vietnam references, into our songs. He had his ear to the ground, Geezer did.\"\n\nThe song \"Iron Man\" was originally entitled \"Iron Bloke\". Upon hearing Iommi play the main guitar riff for the first time, Osbourne remarked in awe that it sounded \"like a big iron bloke walking around\". The title was later changed to \"Iron Man\" as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics.[11] The riff to \"Iron Man\" is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that \"...Tony Iommi turned out to be one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff \u2013 and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away.\" Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. His attempts to warn the populace are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and vengeful, causing the destruction seen in his vision. \"Electric Funeral\" also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands \"it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life.\"[citation needed]\n\nIn the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne said: \"It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday\u00a0... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet.'\" \"You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world,\" Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, \"and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that I wanted to talk about \u2013 political stuff \u2013 so that's what inspired me.\"[citation needed]\n\nIn 2013, Butler told Mojo magazine that the song \"Paranoid\" was \"about depression, because I didn't really know the difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards.\" In 2015, Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: \"I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. I used to get really depressed and it was the only thing that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself.\" According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's \"Communication Breakdown\", with the bassist admitting, \"I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it\u00a0... They were our favourite band by that time\".\n\n\"Planet Caravan\" was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs.[citation needed] Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, \"It was almost one of those 'Should we do this?'\" with Butler adding, \"We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever\u00a0... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend.\" Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. \"Hand of Doom\" dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was \"nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in my head and when we got to \"Hand of Doom\", that's what I wrote it about\".[citation needed]\n\nAccording to Butler, Ward's drum solo \"Rat Salad\" resulted from the band having to play 8 and 3/4-hour spots a night in Europe early in their career. \"Bill used to fill out a whole 45 minutes doing a drum solo just to get rid of that 45 minutes,\" he revealed to Classic Albums. \"I have no idea where the title came from, though.\" While Butler may have now forgotten where the title of \"Rat Salad\" came from, in 1971 he was on record stating it came from a joke about Ward's hair having not been combed.[12] In 2013, Sabbath biographer Mick Wall described the closing track on the album, \"Fairies Wear Boots\", as a \"hard-driving riff sweetened by a beautifully baleful melody\" with a lyric written by Osbourne about a nasty encounter with a group of skinheads.\n\nParanoid was originally titled War Pigs, but the record company allegedly changed it out of fear of a backlash from supporters of the ongoing Vietnam War.[13] Additionally, the band's label felt the title track was more marketable as a single. Ozzy Osbourne states in I Am Ozzy that the name change had nothing to do with the Vietnam War, and was entirely due to the record company deciding the album would be easier to sell if it was named after the single, which had already had significant success by the time the album was released, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart.[10] It was too late, however, to alter the artwork. Joe Smith, who was executive vice-president at Warner Bros. from 1970 to 1972, told Classic Albums that the rest of Warner Bros. didn't want anything to do with them: \"We were in the midst of the war ourselves in this country and what their reasoning was not that important to me. I knew we weren't going to call it 'War Pigs'.\"[11] Regarding the song \"Paranoid\", Smith recalls, \"It was on an acetate. I remember playing it and turning the sound way up and shaking the whole building\u00a0... I said 'I think that's the breakthrough album. I don't understand it but that 'Paranoid' sounds like a great title for an album and a great title for a single.'\"[11] \"That album title had nothing to do with the sleeve,\" Osbourne explained to Phil Alexander in 1998.[11] \"What the fuck does a bloke dressed as a pig with a sword in his hand got to do with being paranoid, I don't know, but they decided to change the album title without changing the artwork.\"[11]\n\nThe cover, with the original War Pigs title in mind, was designed and shot by Keith McMillan (credited as Keef) in Black Park. His assistant, Roger Brown, was the model.[14] The original UK vinyl release was in a gatefold sleeve featuring a black-and-white photo of the band, posed outdoors on a grassy hill. Also shot by Keith McMillan, it was the band's first appearance on album artwork.\n\nThe album was issued in the United Kingdom in September 1970, where its sales were enhanced by the success of the \"Paranoid\" single. \"That single attracted screaming kids\", Iommi recalled in the liner notes to Reunion in 1998. \"We saw people dancing when we played it and we decided that we shouldn't do singles for a long while after that to stay true to the fans who'd liked us before we'd become popular.\" Paranoid's US release was delayed until January 1971,[25] as the Black Sabbath album was still on the charts at the time of its UK release. Paranoid reached No.\u00a012 in the US in March 1971[26] with virtually no radio airplay.[9] From contemporary reviews, an uncredited writer in Disc praised the album, declaring the group's music as \"tight, loud, simple and exciting\" with material based on \"simple, catchy riffs [...] with lyrics that don't put them in the Dylan class.\"[27]\n\nIn a retrospective review, AllMusic's Steve Huey cited Paranoid as \"one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time\", which \"defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history\".[15] Ben Mitchell from Blender said it was \"the greatest metal album of all time\".[16] According to Rolling Stone's Joe Levy, \"Sabbath ruled for bummed-out kids in the Seventies\" and \"nearly every heavy-metal and extreme rock band of the last three decades\", including Metallica, Nirvana and Slipknot, \"owes a debt of worship\" to Iommi's \"crushing\" guitar riffs, Ward and Butler's \"Visigoth rhythm section\" and Osbourne's \"agonized bray\" on tracks such as \"Paranoid\", \"Iron Man\" and \"War Pigs\".[28] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), feeling he could not take the band's horror-themed music seriously enough to appreciate it as anything other than \"camp\", noting that the title cut is especially \"screamworthy\". However, he did note that the band does take musical heaviness to \"undreamt-of extremes\".[17]\n\nGeezer Butler cited Paranoid as the one that stood out to him the most. He explained, \"It was a totally complete album. It wasn't forced, and the chemistry between the four of us was so fluid. I remember getting together to do that record, and we wrote literally everything immediately. Each song came together so easily and had such fire. And each time we would go into rehearsal, we'd come out with a completed song. I think that's why that album is special, because of how naturally things came together. It was the most organic record that Sabbath \u2013 in any era \u2013 ever made. It was completely natural, as it should have been.\"[29]\n\nThe album is currently ranked at No.\u00a0139 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Paranoid's chart success allowed the band to tour the US for the first time in October 1970, which spawned the release of the album's second single \"Iron Man\". Although it failed to reach the top 40, \"Iron Man\" remains one of Black Sabbath's most popular songs, as well as the band's highest charting US single.[30] As of 2014, Paranoid is Black Sabbath's best-selling album, having sold 1.6 million copies in the US since the beginning of the SoundScan era.[31][needs update]\n\nIn 1974, nurse Hillary Pollard from Rawcliffe, North Yorkshire was found dead between a pair of speakers with the Paranoid album on her turntable.[32] She had overdosed on sleeping tablets, with a small enough dosage to make suicide inconclusive.[33] However, the album's possible influence in her potential suicide was still mentioned in the inquest, but ultimately it was decided that Black Sabbath were not to blame for her death. \"A lot of the words in the songs \u2013 a lot of the moods of the songs \u2013 are aggressive,\" Iommi acknowledged. \"Especially in the early days \u2013 Satanic, if you like\u00a0... That was the way it felt, so that was the way we played. But it got out of hand. With Paranoid in England, for instance. There was a girl found dead \u2013 a nurse she was: dead in her room with our album on the turntable going round. And it was taken to court saying that it was because of the album that she was depressed and killed herself, which was totally ridiculous, I think.\"[34]\n\nIn a 1982 interview with The New Music, Butler claimed, \"If the moral majority don't understand it they'll try to put it down, or get other people to read all sorts of things into it\u00a0... The moral majority sort of people picked up on the Satanic part of it. I mean, most of it was about stopping wars and that side of it, and some science fiction stuff. There wasn't that much Satanic stuff, and what there was it wasn't exactly for the devil or anything like that; it was just around at the time and we just brought it to people's attention.\" In the documentary The Black Sabbath Story, Vol. 1, Butler expresses his frustration at how fans misinterpreted the band's lyrics, stating that, \"For instance, on 'Hand of Doom' they'll pick up one sentence out of that and blow it up into this big thing, like as if we're telling everyone to go and shoot smack, where the whole song [\u2026] is against drugs.\"[35]\n\nAll songs written by Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward, and Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nNotes\n\n2016 Super Deluxe Edition\n\nIn 2016, a four-CD Super Deluxe Edition Boxed Set of the album was released on 11 November 2016. The set was released by Rhino in Europe and Warner Brothers in the United States. The first CD contained a 2012 digital remaster in the deluxe edition, and the second CD also included the quadraphonic mix of the album folded down into stereo. The third and fourth CDs included two previously unreleased concerts from Montreux 1970 and Brussels 1970 respectively. Both concerts were widely available on bootlegs prior to their official release and have early live versions of songs with different movement structures and alternate lyrics (which are denoted in the track listing here but do not appear on the sleeves or labels) that would later appear on Paranoid. In addition to the remastered album, quadraphonic mix and unreleased concert recordings, the set included a book with information about the making of the album, as well as a poster and a replica tour guide from the era.[44] The set was re-released in a 5 LP Boxed Set on 9 October 2020, with it being released under Warner Brothers in the United States again, but under Sanctuary Records Group in Europe.[45]\n\nSuper Deluxe Edition Disc Three: Live in Montreux 1970\n\nSuper Deluxe Edition Disc Four: Live in Brussels 1970\n\nReissue notes\n\nWeekly chart performance for Paranoid\n\nYear-end chart performance for Paranoid\n\n\n\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\u2021 Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne", "content": "\n\nJohn Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, and media personality. He rose to prominence during the 1970s as the lead singer of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath, during which period he adopted the nickname \"Prince of Darkness\".[3]\n\nOsbourne became a founding member of Black Sabbath in 1968, providing lead vocals from their self-titled debut album in 1970 to Never Say Die! in 1978. The band was highly influential in the development of heavy metal music, in particular their critically acclaimed releases Paranoid, Master of Reality, and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 due to alcohol and drug problems. He then began a successful solo career with Blizzard of Ozz in 1980 and has released 13 studio albums, the first seven of which received multi-platinum certifications in the US. He has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions. He rejoined in 1997 and helped record the group's final studio album, 13 (2013), before they embarked on a farewell tour that ended with a 2017 performance in their native Birmingham. His longevity and success have earned him the informal title of the \"Godfather of Metal\".[4][5]\n\nOsbourne has sold over 100 million albums, including his solo work and Black Sabbath releases.[6][7] He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Black Sabbath in 2006 and as a solo artist in 2024. He was also inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame both solo and with Black Sabbath in 2005. He has been honoured with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Birmingham Walk of Stars. At the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards, he received the Global Icon Award. In 2015, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Osbourne became a reality television star when he appeared in the MTV reality show The Osbournes alongside his wife and manager Sharon and two of their children, Kelly and Jack. He co-stars with Jack and Kelly in the television series  Ozzy & Jack's World Detour.\n\nOsbourne was born at Maternity Hospital in Marston Green on 3 December 1948,[8] and grew up in the Aston area of Birmingham.[8][9] His mother, Lilian (n\u00e9e Unitt; 1916\u20132001), was a non-observant Catholic who worked at a Lucas factory.[10][11][12] His father, John Thomas \"Jack\" Osbourne (1915\u20131977), worked night shifts as a toolmaker at the General Electric Company.[13][14] Osbourne has three older sisters named Jean, Iris, and Gillian, and two younger brothers named Paul and Tony. The family lived in a small two-bedroom home at 14 Lodge Road in Aston. Osbourne gained the nickname \"Ozzy\" as a child.[15] He dealt with dyslexia at school.[16] His accent has been described as a \"hesitant Brummie\".[17] At the age of 11, he suffered sexual abuse from school bullies.[18] He claims to have attempted suicide multiple times as a teenager.[19][20]\n\nOsbourne left school at the age of 15 and was employed as a construction site labourer, trainee plumber, apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner, and slaughterhouse worker. At the age of 17, Osbourne was convicted of robbing a clothes shop, but was unable to pay the fine; his father also refused to pay it in order to teach him a lesson, resulting in Osbourne spending six weeks in Winson Green Prison.[21][13] He participated in school plays, including Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado and HMS Pinafore.[22] Upon hearing the first hit single of the Beatles at age 14, he became a fan of the band and credited their 1963 song \"She Loves You\" with inspiring him to become a musician.[14][23] In the 2011 documentary God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, he said that the Beatles made him realise that \"[he] was going to be a rock star the rest of [his] life\".[24]\n\nIn late 1967, Geezer Butler formed his first band, Rare Breed, and recruited Osbourne to serve as its vocalist.[15] The band played two shows, and then broke up. Osbourne and Butler reunited in another band, Polka Tulk Blues, which included guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward, whose band Mythology recently broke up. They renamed the band Earth. But after being accidentally booked for a show instead of a different band with the same name, they decided to change the band's name again, settling on the name Black Sabbath in August 1969. The band's name was inspired by the film of the same title.[25] Black Sabbath noticed how people enjoyed being frightened during their appearances, which inspired their decision to play a heavy blues style of music laced with gloomy sounds and lyrics.[8] While recording their first album, Butler read an occult book and woke up seeing a dark figure at the end of his bed. Butler told Osbourne about it, and together they wrote the lyrics to \"Black Sabbath\", their first song in a darker vein.[26][27]\n\nThe band's U.S. record label, Warner Bros. Records, invested only modestly in it, but Black Sabbath met with swift and enduring success. Built around Tony Iommi's guitar riffs, Geezer Butler's lyrics, Bill Ward's dark tempo drumbeats, and topped by Osbourne's eerie vocals, their debut album Black Sabbath and Paranoid were commercially successful and also gained considerable radio airplay. Osbourne recalls, however, that, \"in those days, the band wasn't very popular with the women\".[15]\n\nAt about this time, Osbourne first met his future wife, Sharon Arden.[15] After the unexpected success of their first album, Black Sabbath were considering her father, Don Arden, as their new manager, and Sharon was at that time working as Don's receptionist.[15] Osbourne admits he was attracted to her immediately but assumed that \"she probably thought I was a lunatic\".[15] Osbourne later recalled that the best thing about eventually choosing Don Arden as manager was that he got to see Sharon regularly, though their relationship was strictly professional at that point.[15]\n\nJust five months after the release of Paranoid, the band released Master of Reality. The album reached the top ten in both the United States and UK, and was certified gold in less than two months.[28] In the 1980s, it received platinum certification[28] and went Double Platinum in the early 21st\u00a0century.[28] Reviews of the album were unfavourable. Lester Bangs of Rolling Stone famously dismissed Master of Reality as \"na\u00efve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute doggerel\", although the very same magazine would later place the album at number 298 on their 500\u00a0Greatest Albums of All Time list, compiled in 2003.[29]\n\nIn September 1972, Black Sabbath released Black Sabbath Vol. 4. Critics were dismissive of the album, but it reached gold status in less than a month and was the band's fourth consecutive album to sell over one million copies in the United States.[30][31]\n\nIn November 1973, Black Sabbath released the critically acclaimed Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. For the first time, the band received favourable reviews in the mainstream press. Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone called the album \"an extraordinarily gripping affair\" and \"nothing less than a complete success\".[32] Decades later, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia called the album a \"masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection\", while also claiming the band displayed \"a newfound sense of finesse and maturity\".[33] The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the US.[34] Sabotage was released in July 1975. Again there were favourable reviews. Rolling Stone stated, \"Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever.\"[35] In a retrospective review, AllMusic was less favourable, noting that \"the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume\u00a04 so special was beginning to disintegrate\".[36] Technical Ecstasy, released on 25 September 1976, was also met with mixed reviews. AllMusic gives the album two stars, and notes that the band was \"unravelling at an alarming rate\".[37]\n\nIn 1978, Osbourne left the band for three months to pursue a solo project called Blizzard of Ozz,[38] a title which had been suggested by his father.[39] Three members of the band Necromandus, who had supported Sabbath in Birmingham when they were called Earth, backed Osbourne in the studio and briefly became the first incarnation of his solo band.\n\nAt the request of the other band members, Osbourne rejoined Sabbath.[40] The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, where they wrote and recorded their next album, Never Say Die! \"It took quite a long time\", Iommi said of Never Say Die! \"We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned; we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right; we were all over the place, and everybody was playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day.\"[41]\n\nIn May 1978, Black Sabbath began touring in support of Never Say Die! with Van Halen as an opening act. Reviewers called Sabbath's performance \"tired and uninspired\" in stark contrast to the \"youthful\" performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time.[42] The band recorded their concert at Hammersmith Odeon in June 1978, which was released on video as Never Say Die. The final show of the tour and Osbourne's last appearance with Black Sabbath for another seven years, until 1985, was in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 11 December.\n\nIn 1979, Black Sabbath returned to the studio, but tension and conflict arose between band members. Osbourne recalls being asked to record his vocals over and over, and tracks were manipulated endlessly by Iommi.[43] The relationship between Osbourne and Iommi became contentious. On 27 April 1979, at Iommi's insistence but with the support of Butler and Ward, Osbourne was ejected from Black Sabbath.[15] The reasons provided to him were that he was unreliable and had excessive substance abuse issues compared to the other members. Osbourne claims his drug use and alcohol consumption at that time was neither better nor worse than that of the other members.[44]\n\nThe band replaced Osbourne with former Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio.[27] In a 21 August 1987 interview with Tommy Vance on BBC Radio 1's Friday Rock Show, Dio said, \"I was not, and never will be, Ozzy Osbourne. He was the vocalist and songwriter in that era who helped create that band and make it what it was, and what it is in its classic form.\"[45]\n\nThe conflict between Iommi and Osbourne commenced almost immediately in their working collaboration. Responding to a 1969 flyer that read, \"Ozzy Zig Needs Gig- has own PA\",[46] which was posted by Osbourne in a record store, Iommi and Ward arrived at the listed address to speak with Ozzy Zig, as he then called himself. When Iommi saw Osbourne emerge from another room of the house, he recalled that he knew him as a \"pest\" from their school days.[15] Following Black Sabbath's formation, Iommi reportedly \"punched out\" Osbourne several times over the years when the singer's drunken antics became too much to take.[47] Iommi recalls one incident in the early 1970s in which Osbourne and Butler were fighting in a hotel room. Iommi pulled Osbourne off Butler in an attempt to break up the drunken fight, and the vocalist proceeded to turn around and take a wild swing at him. Iommi responded by knocking Osbourne unconscious with one punch to the jaw.[48]\n\nAfter leaving Black Sabbath, Osbourne recalled, \"I'd got \u00a396,000 for my share of the name, so I'd just locked myself away and spent three months doing coke and booze. My thinking was, 'This is my last party, because after this I'm going back to Birmingham and the dole.\"[49] However, Don Arden signed him to Jet Records with the aim of recording new material. Arden dispatched his daughter Sharon to Los Angeles to \"look after Ozzy's needs, whatever they were\", to protect his investment.[50] Arden initially hoped Osbourne would return to Sabbath, who he was personally managing at that time, and later attempted to convince the singer to name his new band \"Son of Sabbath\", which Osbourne hated.[15] Sharon attempted to convince Osbourne to form a supergroup with guitarist Gary Moore.[15] \"When I lived in Los Angeles\", Moore recalled, \"[Moore's band] G-Force helped him to audition musicians. If drummers were trying out, I played guitar, and if a bassist came along, my drummer would help out. We felt sorry for him, basically. He was always hovering around trying to get me to join, and I wasn't having any of it.\"[51]\n\nIn late 1979, under the management of the Ardens, Osbourne formed the Blizzard of Ozz,[52] featuring drummer Lee Kerslake (of Uriah Heep), bassist-lyricist Bob Daisley (of Rainbow and, later, Uriah Heep), keyboardist Don Airey (of Rainbow and, later, Deep Purple), and guitarist Randy Rhoads (of Quiet Riot). The record company eventually titled the group's debut album Blizzard of Ozz, credited simply to Osbourne, thus commencing his solo career. Co-written with Daisley and Rhoads, it brought Osbourne considerable success on his first solo effort. Though it is generally accepted that Osbourne and Rhoads started the band, Daisley later claimed that he and Osbourne formed the band in England before Rhoads officially joined.[53]\n\nBlizzard of Ozz is one of the few albums amongst the 100 best-sellers of the 1980s to have achieved multi-platinum status without the benefit of a top-40 single. As of August 1997, it had achieved quadruple platinum status, according to RIAA.[54] \"I envied Ozzy's career...\" remarked former Sabbath drummer Bill Ward. \"He seemed to be coming around from whatever it was that he'd gone through, and he seemed to be on his way again; making records and stuff\u2026 I envied it because I wanted that... I was bitter. And I had a thoroughly miserable time.\"[55]\n\nOsbourne's second album, Diary of a Madman, featured more songs co-written with Lee Kerslake. For his work on this album and Blizzard of Ozz, Rhoads[25] was ranked the 85th-greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine in 2003.[56] This album is known for the singles \"Over the Mountain\" and \"Flying High Again\" and, as Osbourne explains in his autobiography, is his personal favourite.[15] Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo soon replaced Kerslake and Daisley. Aldridge had been Osbourne's original choice for drummer, but a commitment to Gary Moore had made him unavailable.[50] Sarzo had played in Quiet Riot with Rhoads, who recommended him for the position.\n\nOn 19 March 1982, the band was in Florida for its Diary of a Madman tour,  a week away from playing Madison Square Garden in New York City. A light aircraft piloted by Andrew Aycock, the band's tour bus driver, carrying Rhoads and Rachel Youngblood, the band's costume and make-up designer, crashed while performing low passes over the band's tour bus. The left wing of the aircraft clipped the bus, causing the plane to graze a tree and crash into the garage of a nearby mansion, killing Rhoads, Aycock, and Youngblood. The crash was ruled the result of \"poor judgement by the pilot in buzzing the bus and misjudging clearance of obstacles\".[57] Experiencing firsthand the horrific death of his close friend and bandmate, Osbourne fell into a deep depression. The tour was cancelled for two weeks while Osbourne, Sharon, and Aldridge returned to Los Angeles to take stock while Sarzo remained in Florida with family.[58]\n\nGary Moore was the first to be approached to replace Rhoads, but refused.[58] With a two-week deadline to find a new guitarist and resume the tour, Robert Sarzo, brother of the band's bassist Rudy Sarzo, was chosen to replace Rhoads. Former Gillan guitarist Bernie Torm\u00e9, however, flew to California from England with the promise from Jet Records that he had the job. Once Sharon realised that Jet Records had already paid Torm\u00e9 an advance, he was reluctantly hired instead of Sarzo. The tour resumed on 1 April 1982, but Torm\u00e9's blues-based style was unpopular with fans. After a handful of shows he informed Sharon that he would be returning to England to continue work on a solo album he had begun before coming to America.[59] At an audition in a hotel room, Osbourne selected Night Ranger's Brad Gillis to finish the tour. The tour culminated in the release of the 1982 live album Speak of the Devil, recorded at the Ritz in New York City. A live tribute album for Rhoads was also later released. Despite the difficulties, Osbourne moved on after Rhoads' death. Speak of the Devil, known in the United Kingdom as Talk of the Devil, was originally planned to consist of live recordings from 1981, primarily from Osbourne's solo work. Under contract to produce a live album, it ended up consisting entirely of Sabbath covers recorded with Gillis, Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge.\n\nIn 1982, Osbourne appeared as lead vocalist on the Was (Not Was) pop dance track \"Shake Your Head (Let's Go to Bed)\". Remixed and rereleased in the early 1990s for a Was (Not Was) hits album in Europe, it reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.[60] In 1983, Jake E. Lee, formerly of Ratt and Rough Cutt, joined Osbourne to record Bark at the Moon. The album, cowritten with Daisley, featured Aldridge and former Rainbow keyboard player Don Airey. The album contains the fan favourite \"Bark at the Moon\". The music video for \"Bark at the Moon\" was partially filmed at the Holloway Sanitorium outside London, England. Within weeks the album became certified gold. It has sold three million copies in the US.[61] 1986's The Ultimate Sin followed (with bassist Phil Soussan[62] and drummer Randy Castillo), and touring behind both albums with former Uriah Heep keyboardist John Sinclair joining prior to the Ultimate Sin tour. At the time of its release, The Ultimate Sin was Osbourne's highest-charting studio album. The RIAA awarded the album Platinum status on 14 May 1986, soon after its release; it was awarded Double Platinum status on 26 October 1994.[63]\n\nJake E. Lee and Osbourne parted ways in 1987. Osbourne continued to struggle with chemical dependency. That year, he commemorated the fifth anniversary of Rhoads' death with Tribute, a collection of live recordings from 1981. In 1988, Osbourne appeared in The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years and told the director Penelope Spheeris that \"sobriety fucking sucks\". Meanwhile, Osbourne found Zakk Wylde, who was the most enduring replacement for Rhoads to date.[64] Together, they recorded No Rest for the Wicked with Castillo on drums, Sinclair on keyboards, and Daisley co-writing lyrics and playing bass. The subsequent tour saw Osbourne reunited with erstwhile Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler on bass. A live EP (entitled Just Say Ozzy) featuring Geezer was released two years later. In 1988, Osbourne performed on the rock ballad \"Close My Eyes Forever\", a duet with Lita Ford, reaching No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100.[65] In 1989, Osbourne performed at the Moscow Music Peace Festival.[66]\n\nSuccessful through the 1980s, Osbourne sustained commercial success into the 1990s, starting with 1991's No More Tears, featuring \"Mama, I'm Coming Home\". The album enjoyed much radio and MTV exposure. It also initiated a practice of bringing in outside composers to help pen Osbourne's solo material instead of relying on his recording ensemble. The album was mixed by veteran rock producer Michael Wagener. Osbourne was awarded a Grammy Award for the track \"I Don't Want to Change the World\" from Live & Loud, for Best Metal Performance of 1994.[67] Wagener also mixed the live album Live & Loud released on 28 June 1993. Intended to be Osbourne's final album, it went platinum four times over,[68] and ranked at number 10 on that year's Billboard rock charts. At this point Osbourne expressed his fatigue with touring, and proclaimed his \"retirement tour\" (which was to be short-lived). It was called \"No More Tours\", a pun on No More Tears. Alice in Chains' Mike Inez took over on bass and Kevin Jones played keyboards as Sinclair was touring with the Cult.\n\nOsbourne's entire CD catalogue was remastered and reissued in 1995. In 1995, Osbourne released Ozzmosis and returned to touring, dubbing his concert performances \"The Retirement Sucks Tour\". The album reached number\u00a04 on the US\u00a0Billboard 200. The RIAA certified the album gold and platinum in that same year, and double platinum in April 1999.[69]\n\nThe line-up on Ozzmosis was Wylde, Butler (who had just quit Black Sabbath again), Steve Vai, and Hardline drummer Deen Castronovo, who later joined Journey. Keyboards were played by Rick Wakeman and producer Michael Beinhorn. The tour maintained Butler and Castronovo and saw Sinclair return, but a major line-up change was the introduction of former David Lee Roth guitarist Joe Holmes. Wylde was considering an offer to join Guns N' Roses. Unable to wait for a decision on Wylde's departure, Osbourne replaced him. In early 1996, Butler and Castronovo left. Inez and Randy Castillo (Lita Ford, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce) filled in. Ultimately, Faith No More's Mike Bordin and former Suicidal Tendencies and future Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo joined on drums and bass respectively. A greatest hits package, The Ozzman Cometh, was issued in 1997.\n\nOsbourne's biggest financial success of the 1990s was a venture named Ozzfest, created and managed by his wife/manager Sharon and assisted by his son Jack. The first Ozzfest was held in Phoenix, Arizona, on 25 October 1996 and in Devore, California, on 26 October. Ozzfest was an instant hit with metal fans, helping many up-and-coming groups who were featured there to broad exposure and commercial success. Some acts shared the bill with a reformed Black Sabbath during the 1997\u00a0Ozzfest tour, beginning in West Palm Beach, Florida. Osbourne reunited with the original members of Sabbath in 1997 and has performed periodically with them since.\n\nSince its beginning, five million people have attended Ozzfest which has grossed over US$100\u00a0million. The festival helped promote many new hard rock and heavy metal acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Ozzfest helped Osbourne to become the first hard rock and heavy metal star to hit $50\u00a0million in merchandise sales. In 2005, Osbourne and his wife Sharon starred in an MTV competition reality show entitled \"Battle for Ozzfest\". A number of yet unsigned bands send one member to compete in a challenge to win a spot on the 2005\u00a0Ozzfest and a possible recording contract. Shortly after Ozzfest 2005, Osbourne announced that he will no longer headline Ozzfest. Although he announced his retirement from Ozzfest, Osbourne came back headlining the tour. In 2006 Osbourne closed the event for just over half the concerts, leaving the others to be closed by System of a Down. He also played the closing act for the second stage at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California on 1 July as well as Randalls Island, New York on 29 July. After the concert in Bristol, Virginia, Osbourne announced he would return for another year of Ozzfest in 2007.\n\nTickets for the 2007 tour were offered to fans free of charge, which led to some controversy. In 2008, Ozzfest was reduced to a one-day event in Dallas, where Osbourne played, along with Metallica and King Diamond. In 2010, the tour opened with a Jersey Shore spoof skit starring Osbourne.[70] Osbourne appeared as the headliner closing the show after opening acts Halford and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. The tour, though small (only six US venues and one UK venue were played), generated rave reviews.[71][72][73][74]\n\nDown to Earth, Osbourne's first album of new studio material in six years, was released on 16 October 2001. A live album, Live at Budokan, followed in 2002. Down to Earth, which achieved platinum status in 2003, featured the single \"Dreamer\", a song which peaked at number\u00a010 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks.[75] In June 2002, Osbourne was invited to participate in the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, performing the Black Sabbath anthem \"Paranoid\" at the Party at the Palace concert in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.[76] In 2003, Osbourne recruited former Metallica bassist Jason Newsted, though his time with Osbourne would be short. Osbourne's former bassist Robert Trujillo replaced Newsted in Metallica during this same period.\n\nOn 8 December 2003, Osbourne was rushed into emergency surgery at Slough's Wexham Park Hospital when he had an accident with his quad bike on his estate in Jordans, Buckinghamshire.[77] Osbourne broke his collar bone, eight ribs, and a neck vertebra.[77] An operation was performed to lift the collarbone, which was believed to be resting on a major artery and interrupting blood flow to the arm. Sharon later revealed that Osbourne had stopped breathing following the crash and was resuscitated by Osbourne's then personal bodyguard, Sam Ruston. While in hospital, Osbourne achieved his first ever UK number one single, a duet of the Black Sabbath ballad, \"Changes\" with daughter Kelly.[78] In doing so, he broke the record of the longest period between an artist's first UK chart appearance (with Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\", number four in August 1970) and their first number one hit: a gap of 33\u00a0years.[78] Since the quad accident, apart from some short-term memory problems, he fully recovered and headlined the 2004\u00a0Ozzfest, in the reunited Black Sabbath.\n\nIn March 2005, Osbourne released a box set called Prince of Darkness. The first and second discs are collections of live performances, B-sides, demos and singles. The third disc contained duets and other odd tracks with other artists, including \"Born to Be Wild\" with Miss Piggy. The fourth disc, is entirely new material where Osbourne covers his favourite songs by his biggest influences and favourite bands, including the Beatles, John Lennon, David Bowie and others.[79] In November 2005, Osbourne released the covers album Under Cover, featuring 10 songs from the fourth disc of Prince of Darkness and 3 more songs.[80] Osbourne's band for this album included Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell,[81] bassist Chris Wyse[81] and Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin.[81]\n\nOsbourne also helped judge the 2005 UK series of the X-Factor where his wife Sharon was one of the main judges.[82] In March 2006, he said that he hoped to release a new studio album soon with longtime on-off guitarist, Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society. In October 2006, it was announced that Tony Iommi, Ronnie James Dio, Vinny Appice, and Geezer Butler would be touring together again, though not as Black Sabbath but under the moniker \"Heaven & Hell\", the title of Dio's first Black Sabbath album.\n\nOsbourne's next album, titled Black Rain, was released on 22 May 2007. His first new studio album in almost six years, it featured a more serious tone than previous albums. \"I thought I'd never write again without any stimulation... But you know what? Instead of picking up the bottle I just got honest and said, 'I don't want life to go [to pieces]'\", Osbourne stated to Billboard magazine.[83]\n\nOsbourne revealed in July 2009 that he was currently seeking a new guitar player. While he states that he has not fallen out with Zakk Wylde, he said he felt his songs were beginning to sound like Black Label Society and fancied a change.[84] In August 2009, Osbourne performed at the gaming festival BlizzCon with a new guitarist in his line-up, Gus G.[85] Osbourne also provided his voice and likeness to the video game Br\u00fctal Legend character The Guardian of Metal.[86] In November, Slash featured Osbourne on vocals in his single \"Crucify the Dead\",[87] and Osbourne with wife Sharon were guest hosts on WWE Raw.[88] In December, Osbourne announced he would be releasing a new album titled Soul Sucka with Gus\u00a0G, Tommy Clufetos on drums, and Blasko on bass.[89] Negative fan feedback was brought to Osbourne's attention regarding the album title. In respect of fan opinion, on 29 March Osbourne announced his album would be renamed Scream.[90]\n\nOn 13 April 2010, Osbourne announced the release date for Scream would be 15 June 2010.[91] The release date was later changed to a week later. A single from the album, \"Let Me Hear You Scream\", debuted on 14 April 2010 episode of CSI: NY. The song spent eight weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs chart, peaking at No. 7.\n\nOn 9 August 2010, Osbourne announced that the second single from the album would be \"Life Won't Wait\" and the video for the song would be directed by his son Jack.[92] When asked of his opinions on Scream in an interview, Osbourne announced that he is \"already thinking about the next album\". Osbourne's current drummer, Tommy Clufetos, has reflected this sentiment, saying that \"We are already coming up with new ideas backstage, in the hotel rooms and at soundcheck and have a bunch of ideas recorded\".[93] In October 2014, Osbourne released Memoirs of a Madman, a collection celebrating his entire solo career. A CD version contained 17 singles from across his career, never before compiled together. The DVD version contained music videos, live performances, and interviews.[94]\n\nIn August 2015, Epic Records president Sylvia Rhone confirmed with Billboard that Osbourne was working on another studio album;[95][96][97][98] in September 2019, Osbourne announced he had finished the album in four weeks following his collaboration with Post Malone.[99][100] In April 2017, it was announced that guitarist Zakk Wylde would reunite with Osbourne for a summer tour to mark the 30th anniversary of their first collaboration on 1988's No Rest for the Wicked.[101] The first show of the tour took place on 14 July at the Rock USA Festival in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.[102]\n\nOn 6 November 2017, Osbourne was announced as the headline act for the Sunday of the 2018 Download Festival held annually at Donington Park in Leicestershire, England. Having previously graced the main stage in previous years fronting Black Sabbath, this will be his first-ever Download headline solo appearance. The Download Festival set comes as part of Osbourne's final world tour announcement that morning.[103]\n\nOn 6 February 2018, Osbourne announced that he would embark on his final world tour dubbed No More Tours II, a reference to his 1992 tour of the same name, with support from Stone Sour on the North American portion of the tour.[104] He later insisted that he would not retire, \"It's 'No More Tours', so I'm just not doing world tours anymore. I'm still going to be doing gigs, but I'm not going on tour for six months at a time anymore. I'd like to spend some time at home.\"[105]\n\nOn 6 September 2019, Osbourne featured on the song \"Take What You Want\" by Post Malone. The song would peak on the Billboard Hot 100 charts at number 8, making it Osbourne's first US Top 10 single in 30 years since he was featured on Lita Ford's \"Close My Eyes Forever\".[106]\n\nOn 21 February 2020, Osbourne released his first solo album in almost ten years, Ordinary Man, which received positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart.[107][108] A few days after the release, Osbourne told iHeartRadio that he wanted to make another album with Andrew Watt, the main producer of Ordinary Man.[109][110] One week after the release of the album, an 8-bit video game dedicated to Osbourne was released, called Legend of Ozzy.[111] Osbourne has started working on his follow up album, once again with Andrew Watt.[112] In November 2021, Sony announced that Osbourne's album would be released within six months;[113] it was also announced that Zakk Wylde will have full involvement in the album following his absence on Ordinary Man.[114] On 24 June 2022, Osbourne announced his thirteenth album would be titled Patient Number 9 and released the title track along with an accompanying music video that same day. The album was released on 9 September 2022.[115]\n\nIn January 2023, Osbourne announced that the European leg of the No More Tours II would be canceled after almost two years of being postponed. Osbourne effectively retired from touring, citing his accident in 2019 which resulted in the singer suffering spinal damage, while affirming his plan to continue smaller-scale live performances as his health permitted.[116][117] In September 2023, he revealed that he was working on a new album with a planned 2024 release while also preparing to go on the road following a successful spinal surgery earlier that month.[118]\n\nIn 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Osbourne at number 112 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[119]\n\nOsbourne achieved greater celebrity status via his own brand of reality television. The Osbournes, a series featuring the domestic life of Osbourne and his family (wife Sharon, children Jack and Kelly, occasional appearances from his son Louis, but eldest daughter Aimee did not participate). The program became one of MTV's greatest hits. It premiered on 5 March 2002, and the final episode aired on 21 March 2005.[120]\n\nThe success of The Osbournes led Osbourne and the rest of his family to host the 30th Annual American Music Awards in January 2003.[121][122] The night was marked with constant \"bleeping\" due to some of the lewd and raunchy remarks made by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. Presenter Patricia Heaton walked out midway in disgust.[123] On 20 February 2008, Ozzy, Sharon, Kelly and Jack Osbourne hosted the 2008 BRIT Awards held at Earls Court, London.[124] Ozzy appeared in a TV commercial for I Can't Believe It's Not Butter! which began airing in the UK in February 2006.[125]\n\nOsbourne appears in a commercial for the online video game World of Warcraft.[126] He was also featured in the music video game Guitar Hero World Tour as a playable character. He becomes unlocked upon completing \"Mr. Crowley\" and \"Crazy Train\" in the vocalist career. The 2002 dark fantasy combat flight simulator Savage Skies was initially developed under the title Ozzy's Black Skies and was to feature his likeness as well as songs from both his stint in Black Sabbath as well as his solo career,[127][128] but licensing issues forced developer iRock Interactive to re-tool the game and release it without the Osbourne branding.[129]\n\nIn October 2009, Osbourne published I Am Ozzy, his autobiography.[130] Osbourne says ghost writer Chris Ayres told the singer he has enough material for a second book. A movie adaptation of I\u00a0Am Ozzy is also in the works, and Osbourne says he hopes \"an unknown guy from England\" will get the role over an established actor, while Sharon stated she would choose established English actress Carey Mulligan to play her.[131]\n\nA documentary film about Osbourne's life and career, entitled God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, premiered in April 2011 at the Tribeca Film Festival and was released on DVD in November 2011.[132] The film was produced by Osbourne's son Jack.[133] On 15 May 2013 Osbourne, along with the current members of Black Sabbath, appeared in an episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation titled \"Skin in the Game\". The History Channel premiered a comedy reality television series starring Ozzy Osbourne and his son Jack Osbourne on 24 July 2016, named Ozzy & Jack's World Detour.[134] During each episode Ozzy and Jack visit one or more sites to learn about history from experts, and explore unusual or quirky aspects of their background.\n\nOsbourne appeared in a November 2017 episode of Gogglebox along with other UK celebrities such as Ed Sheeran, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK's Stand Up to Cancer fundraising campaign.[135] In November 2017, Osbourne entered into a new realm of sponsorship as he signed on as an ambassador of a rock-themed online casino known as Metal Casino, which was founded by metal music fans in August 2017.[136] In February 2019, Osbourne's merchandising partner announced that Ozzy would have his own branded online slots game as part of the NetEnt Rocks music-themed portfolio.[137]\n\nIt was announced on 11 November 2011 during a news conference at the Whisky a Go Go club on West Hollywood's Sunset Strip that the original Black Sabbath lineup of Ozzy, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward would reunite for a world tour and new album, to be produced by Rick Rubin.[138] Ward dropped out for contractual reasons, but the project continued with Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk stepping in for Ward on drums. On 21 May 2012, Black Sabbath played at the O2 Academy in their hometown Birmingham, their first concert since their reunion.[139] The album, entitled 13, was released on 11 June 2013,[140] and topped both the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200.[141][142]\n\nIn January 2016, the band began a farewell tour, titled \"The End\",  signifying the final performances of Black Sabbath.[143][144] \nThe final shows of The End tour took place at the Genting Arena in their home city of Birmingham, England on 2 and 4 February 2017, with Tommy Clufetos replacing Bill Ward as the drummer for the final show.[145][146]\n\nOn 8 August 2022, Osbourne and Iommi made a surprise appearance, during the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. This marked Osbourne's first live performance in three years, following a period of ill health.[147][148]\n\nThroughout his career, many religious groups have accused Osbourne of being a negative influence on teenagers, stating that his genre of rock music has been used to glorify Satanism. Scholar Christopher M. Moreman compared the controversy to those levelled against the occultist Aleister Crowley. Both were demonised by the media and some religious groups for their antics. Although Osbourne tempts the comparison with his song \"Mr. Crowley\", he denies being a Satanist; conversely, it has been reported that Osbourne is a member of the Church of England and that he prays before taking the stage each night before every concert.[149][150]\n\nIn 1981, after signing his first solo career record deal, Osbourne bit the head off a dove during a meeting with CBS Records executives in Los Angeles.[151] Apparently, he had planned to release doves into the air as a sign of peace, but due to being intoxicated at the time, he instead grabbed a dove and bit its head off. He then spat the head out,[151][152] with blood still dripping from his lips. Due to its controversy, the head-biting act has been parodied and alluded to several times throughout his career and is part of what made Osbourne famous.[153]\n\n\"I'm like the Dennis the Menace kind of crazy. Fun crazy, I hope.\"\n\nOn 20 January 1982, Osbourne bit the head off a bat[155] that he thought was rubber while performing at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Des Moines, Iowa. According to a 2004 Rolling Stone article, the bat was alive at the time;[156] however, 17-year-old Mark Neal, who threw it onto the stage, said it was brought to the show dead.[151] According to Osbourne in the booklet to the 2002 edition of Diary of a Madman, the bat was not only alive but managed to bite him, resulting in Osbourne being treated for rabies. On 20 January 2019, Osbourne commemorated the 37th anniversary of the bat incident by offering an \"Ozzy Plush Bat\" toy \"with detachable head\" for sale on his personal web-store. The site claimed the first batch of toys sold out within hours.[157]\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1983, Canadian youth James Jollimore killed a woman and her two sons in Halifax, Nova Scotia, after listening to the \"Bark at the Moon\" song. A friend of the murderer quoted: \"Jimmy said that every time he listened to the song, he felt strange inside ... He said when he heard it on New Year's Eve, he went out and stabbed someone\".[158]\n\nIn 1984, California teenager John McCollum committed suicide while listening to Osbourne's \"Suicide Solution\". The song deals with the dangers of alcohol misuse. McCollum's suicide led to allegations that Osbourne promoted suicide in his songs. McCollum had clinical depression. His parents sued Osbourne (McCollum v. CBS)[159] for their son's death, saying the lyrics in the song, \"Where to hide, suicide is the only way out. Don't you know what it's really about?\" convinced McCollum to commit suicide. The family's lawyer suggested that Osbourne should be criminally charged for encouraging a young person to commit suicide, but the courts ruled in Osbourne's favour, saying there was no connection between the song and McCollum's suicide. Osbourne was sued for the same reason in 1991 (Waller v. Osbourne), by the parents of Michael Waller, for $9\u00a0million, but the courts once again ruled in Osbourne's favour.[160]\n\nIn lawsuits filed in 2000 and 2002 which were dismissed by the courts in 2003, former band members Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake, and Phil Soussan stated that Osbourne was delinquent in paying them royalties and had denied them due credit on albums they played on.[161][162] In November 2003, a Federal Appeals Court unanimously upheld the dismissal by the US District Court for the Central District of California of the lawsuit brought by Daisley and Kerslake. The US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Osbourne does not owe any royalties or credit to the former band members who were let go in 1981.[163] To resolve further issues, management chose to replace Daisley and Kerslake's contributions on the original masters, replacing them with Robert Trujillo on bass and Mike Bordin on drums. The albums were then reissued.[164] The original tracks have since been restored in accordance with the 30th anniversary of those albums.\n\nIn July 2010, Osbourne and Tony Iommi decided to discontinue the court proceedings over ownership of the Black Sabbath trademark. As reported to Blabbermouth, \"Both parties are glad to put this behind them and to cooperate for the future and would like it to be known that the issue was never personal, it was always business.\"[165]\n\nIn 1971, Osbourne met his first wife Thelma Riley at the Rum Runner, the Birmingham nightclub where she worked.[15] They were married later that year and children Jessica and Louis were soon born. Osbourne later referred to his first marriage as \"a terrible mistake\".[15] His drug and alcohol use, coupled with his frequent absences while touring with Black Sabbath, took their toll on his family life; his children later complained that he was not a good father. In the 2011 documentary film God Bless Ozzy Osbourne, produced by his son Jack, Osbourne admitted that he could not even remember when Louis and Jessica were born.[166]\n\nOsbourne married his manager Sharon Arden on 4 July 1982 and the couple had three children together: Aimee (born 2 September 1983), Kelly (born 27 October 1984), and Jack (born 8 November 1985). He later confessed that the well-known \"Fourth of July\" Independence Day date was chosen so that he would never forget his anniversary. Guitarist Randy Rhoads predicted in 1981 that the couple would \"probably get married someday\" despite their constant bickering and the fact that Osbourne was still married to Thelma at the time.[59] Osbourne has multiple grandchildren.[167]\n\nOsbourne wrote a song for his daughter Aimee, which appeared as a B-side on the album Ozzmosis. At the end of the song, said daughter can be heard saying \"I'll always be your angel\", referring to the song's chorus lyrics. The song \"My Little Man\", which appears on Ozzmosis, was written about his son Jack. The Osbourne family divide their time between homes in Buckinghamshire[168] and Los Angeles.[169]\n\nThough Osbourne has long been accused of being a Satanist, The New York Times reported in 1992 that he was a practicing member of the Church of England and prayed before each show.[170] In 2002, Osbourne and wife Sharon were invited to the White House Correspondents' Association dinner by Fox News Channel correspondent Greta Van Susteren for that year's event. Then-President George W. Bush noted Osbourne's presence by joking, \"The thing about Ozzy is, he's made a lot of big hit recordings \u2013 'Party with the Animals', 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', 'Facing Hell', 'Black Skies' and 'Bloodbath in Paradise'. Ozzy, Mom loves your stuff.\"[171]\n\nIn 2010, during an interview on the Howard Stern Show, Ozzy said that it took him 19 attempts to get his driver\u2019s license because he was so drunk.[172]\n\nOzzy and his wife are one of the UK's richest couples, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. They ranked at number 458 in 2005, with an estimated \u00a3100\u00a0million earned from recording, touring, and TV\u00a0shows. Osbourne has over 15\u00a0tattoos, the most famous of which are the letters O-Z-Z-Y across the knuckles of his left hand. This was his first tattoo, created by himself as a teenager with a sewing needle and pencil lead.[13] A longtime fan of the comedy troupe Monty Python, in a 2010 interview with Us Weekly Osbourne stated, \"My favourite movie is Monty Python's Life of Brian\".[173] Osbourne suffered minor burns after a small house fire in January 2013.[174] On his 65th birthday on 3 December 2013, he asked fans to celebrate his birthday by donating to the Royal Marsden cancer charity in London.[175]\n\nOn 6 February 2019, Osbourne was hospitalised in an undisclosed location on his doctor's advice due to flu complications, postponing the European leg of his \"No More Tours II\" tour. The issue was described as a \"severe upper-respiratory infection\" following a bout with the flu which his doctor feared could develop into pneumonia, given the physicality of the live performances and an extensive travel schedule throughout Europe in harsh winter conditions.[176] Pneumonia targets the airway and breathing and is frequently fatal in elderly patients, necessitating the preventive measures.[177]\n\nBy 12 February 2019, Osbourne had been moved to intensive care. Tour promoters Live Nation said in a statement that they were hopeful that Osbourne would be \"fit and healthy\" and able to honour tour dates in Australia and New Zealand in March.[178] Osbourne later cancelled the tour entirely, and ultimately all shows scheduled for 2019, after sustaining serious injuries from a fall in his Los Angeles home while still recovering from pneumonia.[179] He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in February 2019, which he publicly revealed in January 2020.[180][181]\n\nIn February 2020, Osbourne cancelled the 2020 North American tour, seeking treatment in Switzerland until April.[182]\n\nOsbourne has misused alcohol and other drugs for most of his adult life. He admitted to Sounds in 1978, \"I get high, I get fucked up ... what the hell's wrong with getting fucked up? There must be something wrong with the system if so many people have to get fucked up ... I never take dope or anything before I go on stage. I'll smoke a joint or whatever afterwards.\"[183] Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi said that while all the band were involved with alcohol and other drugs to various degrees in the 1970s, Osbourne had the unhealthiest lifestyle of them all. Despite this, said Iommi, he was typically the only one left standing when the others were \"out for the count\".[48] Longtime guitarist Zakk Wylde has attributed Osbourne's longevity in spite of decades of substance misuse to \"a very special kind of fortitude that's bigger than King Kong and Godzilla combined... seriously, he's hard as nails, man!\"[184]\n\nOsbourne's first experience with cocaine was in early 1971 at a hotel in Denver, Colorado, after a show Black Sabbath had done with Mountain.[15] He states that Mountain's guitarist, Leslie West, introduced him to the drug.[15] Though West was reluctant to take credit for introducing Osbourne to cocaine, Osbourne remembers the experience quite clearly: \"When you come from Aston and you fall in love with cocaine, you remember when you started. It's like having your first fuck!\"[15] Osbourne says that upon first trying the drug, \"The world went a bit fuzzy after that.\"[15]\n\nOsbourne claimed to have taken LSD every day for two years while in Black Sabbath. During the end of his time with the band, he said he \"got very drunk and very stoned every single day.\"[19][20]\n\nOsbourne's drug and alcohol misuse have, at times, caused friction within his band. Don Airey, keyboardist for Osbourne during his early solo career, has said that the vocalist's substance-misuse issues were what ultimately caused him to leave the band.[185] In his memoir Off the Rails, former bassist Rudy Sarzo detailed the frustrations felt by him and his bandmates as they coped with life on the road with the vocalist, who was in a state of near-constant inebriation and was often so hungover that he would refuse to perform. When he was able to perform, his voice was often so damaged from cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs that the performance suffered. Many shows on the American leg of the 1981-82 Diary of a Madman tour were simply cancelled, and the members of his band quickly began to tire of the unpredictability, coupled with the often violent mood swings he was prone to when either drunk or high.[59]\n\nOsbourne claims in his autobiography that he was invited in 1981 to a meeting with the head of CBS Europe in Germany. Intoxicated, he decided to lighten the mood by performing a striptease on the table and then kissing the record executive on the lips. According to his wife Sharon, he had actually performed a goose-step up and down the table and urinated in the executive's wine, but was too drunk to remember.[44]\n\nOn 18 February 1982, while wearing his future wife Sharon's dress for a photoshoot near the Alamo, Osbourne drunkenly urinated on a cenotaph erected in honour of those who died at the Battle of the Alamo in Texas, across the street from the actual building.[186] A police officer arrested Osbourne,[153] and he was subsequently banned from the city of San Antonio for a decade.[187] Osbourne had been on a long drinking binge and earlier that same day had drunkenly fired his entire band, including Randy Rhoads, after they had informed him that they would not participate in a planned live album of Black Sabbath songs. He also physically attacked Rhoads and Rudy Sarzo in a hotel bar that morning, and Sharon informed the band that she feared he had \"finally snapped\". Osbourne later had no memory of firing his band and the tour continued, though his relationship with Rhoads never fully recovered.[59] In May 1984, Osbourne was arrested in Memphis, Tennessee, again for public intoxication.[188] The most notorious incident came in August 1989, when Sharon claimed that Ozzy had tried to strangle her after returning home from the  Moscow Music Peace Festival, in a haze of alcohol and drugs.[189] The incident led Ozzy to six months in rehabilitation, after which time, Sharon regained her faith in her husband and did not press charges.[190]\n\nThough he has managed to remain clean and sober for extended periods in recent years,[191] Osbourne has frequently commented on his former wild lifestyle, expressing bewilderment at his own survival through 40\u00a0years of drug and alcohol misuse.[192] Upon being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Osbourne spent the next three months locked in his hotel room taking vast amounts of alcohol and other drugs all day, every day.[193] He claims that he would certainly have died if his future wife Sharon had not offered to manage him as a solo artist.[194]\n\nIn 2003, Osbourne told the Los Angeles Times how he was nearly incapacitated by medication prescribed by a Beverly Hills doctor.[195] The doctor was alleged to have prescribed 13,000 doses of 32 drugs in one year.[196] However, after a nine-year investigation by the Medical Board of California, the Beverly Hills physician was exonerated of all charges of excessive prescribing.[197]\n\nOsbourne experienced tremors for some years and linked them to his continuous drug misuse. In May 2005, he found out it was actually Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition, the symptoms of which are similar to Parkinson's disease. Osbourne will have to take daily medication for the rest of his life to combat the involuntary shudders associated with the condition.[198][unreliable medical source?] Osbourne has also shown symptoms of mild hearing loss, as depicted in the television show, The Osbournes, where he often asks his family to repeat what they say. At the TEDMED Conference in October 2010, scientists from Knome, a Massachusetts human genome interpretation company, joined Osbourne on stage to discuss their analysis of Osbourne's whole genome, which shed light on how the famously hard-living rocker has survived decades of drug misuse.[199]\n\nIn April 2013, Osbourne revealed through Facebook that he had resumed smoking, drinking and doing drugs for the past year and a half, stating he \"was in a very dark place\" but said he had been sober again since early March. He also apologised to Sharon, his family, friends, bandmates and his fans for his \"insane\" behaviour during that period.[200] In a February 2021 interview with Variety, Ozzy and his son Jack (who has been sober for 17 years) opened up about their recovery. Ozzy revealed he had been sober for about seven years.[201]\n\nOsbourne is considered an icon of hard rock music, and one of the founders of heavy metal music through his work with Black Sabbath. He dislikes being categorized as metal, stating that while his band \"plays heavy\", other bands that are considered metal are \"really heavy\". \"When you get pigeonholed with a certain [genre], it can be very difficult to do something a bit lighter or an acoustic track or whatever you want to do. Back in the day, it was always just rock music. It\u2019s still just rock music.\"[202][203]\n\nCurrent members:\n\nOsbourne has received several awards for his contributions to the music community. In 1994, he was awarded a Grammy Award for the track \"I Don't Want to Change the World\" from Live\u00a0&\u00a0Loud for Best Metal Performance of 1994.[67] At the 2004 NME Awards in London, Osbourne received the award for Godlike Genius.[204] In 2005 Osbourne was inducted into the UK\u00a0Music Hall of Fame both as a solo artist and as a member of Black Sabbath.[205] In 2006, he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Black Sabbath bandmates Tony Iommi, Bill Ward, and Geezer Butler.[206] In 2024, Osbourne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for his solo career.[207][208]\n\nIn 2007 Osbourne was honoured at the second annual VH1\u00a0Rock Honors, along with Genesis, Heart, and ZZ\u00a0Top. In addition, that year a bronze star honouring Osbourne was placed on Broad Street in Birmingham, England while Osbourne watched.[209] On 18 May Osbourne had received notice that he would be the first inductee into The Birmingham Walk of Stars. He was presented the award by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham. \"I am really honoured\", he said, \"All my family is here and I thank everyone for this reception\u2014I'm absolutely knocked out\".[209]\n\nIn 2008 Osbourne was crowned with the prestigious Living Legend award in the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards. Past recipients include Alice Cooper, Lemmy, Jimmy Page. Slash, the former Guns\u00a0N'\u00a0Roses guitarist, presented the award.[210] In 2010 Osbourne won the \"Literary Achievement\" honour for his memoir, I\u00a0Am Ozzy, at the Guys Choice Awards at Sony Pictures Studio in Culver City, California. Osbourne was presented with the award by Sir Ben Kingsley. The book debuted at No.\u00a02 on the New York Times' hardcover non-fiction best-seller list.[211] Osbourne was also a judge for the 6th,[212] 10th and 11th[213] annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. In May 2015, Osbourne received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors at a ceremony held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London.[214] In 2016, Osbourne had a tram named after him in his home city of Birmingham.[215]\n\nIn April 2021, Osbourne was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame for his various appearances, notably for his appearance at WrestleMania 2 in 1986 when he and Lou Albano managed The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and The Dynamite Kid) in their WWF Tag Team Championship win over The Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake).[216]\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hetfield", "content": "\n\nJames Alan Hetfield (born August 3, 1963) is an American musician. He is the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, co-founder, and a primary songwriter of heavy metal band Metallica. He is mainly known for his intricate rhythm playing, but occasionally performs lead guitar duties and solos both live and in studio. Hetfield co-founded Metallica in October 1981 after answering an advertisement by drummer Lars Ulrich in the Los Angeles newspaper The Recycler. Metallica has won nine Grammy Awards and released 11 studio albums, three live albums, four extended plays, and 24 singles. Hetfield is often regarded as one of the greatest heavy metal rhythm guitar players of all time.[1]\n\nIn 2009, Hetfield was ranked at No. 8 in Joel McIver's book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists[2] and No. 24 by Hit Parader on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time.[3] In Guitar World's poll, Hetfield was placed as the 19th greatest guitarist of all time,[4] as well as being placed second (along with Metallica lead guitarist Kirk Hammett) in The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists poll of the same magazine.[5] Rolling Stone placed him along with bandmate Kirk Hammett as the 23rd greatest guitarist of all time.[6]\n\nHetfield was born on August 3, 1963,[7] in Downey, California, the son of Cynthia Bassett (n\u00e9e Nourse), a light opera singer, and Virgil Lee Hetfield, a truck driver.[8] He is of English, German, Irish, and Scottish descent.[9][10] He has two older half-brothers from his mother's first marriage and one younger sister. His parents divorced in 1976 when Hetfield was 13. They were very strict Christian Scientists, and in accordance with their beliefs, they strongly disapproved of medicine or any other medical treatment and remained loyal to their faith, even as Cynthia was dying from cancer. This upbringing became the inspiration for many of Hetfield's lyrics during his career with Metallica, most notably in the songs \"Dyers Eve\" and \"The God That Failed\" from ...And Justice for All and Metallica respectively. Cynthia died of cancer in February 1980, when Hetfield was 16 years old. After the death of his mother, Hetfield went to live with his older half-brother David. Virgil died in early 1996, before the release of Metallica's Load.[11] Hetfield attended Downey High School for his freshman and sophomore years[12] and graduated from Brea Olinda High School in 1981.\n\nHetfield was nine years old when he first began piano lessons, after which he took on his half-brother David's drums and finally, at the age of 14, he began to play guitar with Robert Okner.[13] He was also in a few bands as a teenager\u00a0\u2013  one being Leather Charm, and another, Obsession. Hetfield identifies Aerosmith as having been his main musical influence as a child,[14] and has said they were the reason he wanted to play guitar.\n\nIn the early days of the band, Metallica experimented with a few different vocal and guitar combinations, essentially creating a setup similar to that of British metal band Diamond Head, another major influence on Hetfield. Some of the options considered included adding another guitar player, having John Roads play lead guitar, as well as asking John Bush from Armored Saint (who later joined Anthrax) to sing for the band. The finalized line-up of the band became Hetfield (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Lars Ulrich (drums), Dave Mustaine (lead guitar), and Ron McGovney (bass), who was soon replaced by Cliff Burton. Hetfield referred to their early sound as power metal. The term \"thrash metal\" was first used when Kerrang journalist Malcolm Dome described the Anthrax song \"Metal Thrashing Mad\" in an issue of Kerrang in February 1984.[15]\n\nFrom 1982 to 1983, Mustaine's overly aggressive behavior and drinking problems led to mounting tensions between himself and Hetfield.[16] Mustaine once poured beer onto McGovney's bass.[16] On April 1, 1983, the band recruited lead guitarist Kirk Hammett from the band Exodus, and 10 days later, Hetfield and Ulrich officially fired Mustaine from the band due to his erratic indifference.[16][17] Mustaine was sent home on a four-day bus journey from New York to Los Angeles, and went on to form the heavy metal band Megadeth.\n\nSince the recording of Load, Hammett has been recording rhythm guitars as well. Hetfield occasionally plays guitar solos on songs such as \"Nothing Else Matters\", \"My Friend of Misery\", \"Just a Bullet Away\", the outro solo on \"The Outlaw Torn\", the second solo on \"To Live Is to Die\", the first solo on \"Suicide and Redemption\", the first solo on \"Master of Puppets\", and the harmonized solo on \"Orion\". He also writes the majority of the guitar harmonies, as well as writing the lyrics, vocal melodies, and co-arranging the songs with Ulrich.\n\nHetfield was involved in an on-stage accident at Olympic Stadium in Montreal during the Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour on August 8, 1992. During the song \"Fade to Black\", a pyrotechnic charge reacted. Hetfield's guitar protected him from the full force of the blast, but it struck his left side, burning his hand, arm, eyebrows, face and hair. He suffered second and third-degree burns, but was back on stage 17 days later, although his guitar duties were delegated to former guitar tech and Metal Church guitarist John Marshall for four weeks while he made a full recovery.[18]\n\nHetfield also suffered a broken arm a number of times while skateboarding, which prevented him from playing guitar on stage, and subsequently caused Hetfield's management company, Q Prime, to put a clause in Hetfield's contract forbidding him to ride a skateboard while Metallica was touring.[19] During a live performance on tour for Metallica, Hetfield experienced complications with his vocals after performing a cover of the Anti-Nowhere League song \"So What?\", forcing him to take vocal lessons for the first time. He did basic warm-up exercises to piano keys with his vocal coach, who also gave him a cassette tape of the piano warm-up for future use. Hetfield still uses the same cassette he was given in the early 1990s to this day before any live performance or any recording Metallica does. Hetfield talks about his vocal training endeavors in the Metallica documentary film, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, produced and directed by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky.[20]\n\nDuring the recording of the band's eighth studio album St. Anger in 2001, Hetfield went into rehab to address his alcohol usage. He rejoined the band after seven months in rehab and four months recovering with his family. His health problems are featured in Some Kind of Monster.[20] Some Kind of Monster also shows the making of the St. Anger album, and documents the various conflicts and issues the band were facing at the time including the departure of Jason Newsted, alcoholism, family commitments, and the future of the band.\n\nHetfield and Metallica recruited Ozzy Osbourne bassist Robert Trujillo. Osbourne replaced him with Jason Newsted shortly after Trujillo's transfer. The new line-up has continued to make music and tour worldwide. Metallica's ninth studio album, Death Magnetic, was released on September 12, 2008. Like St. Anger and every album of original material released by Metallica since 1991's Metallica, Death Magnetic went to #1 on the Billboard charts in over 30 countries during its first week of release.[21]\n\nOn April 4, 2009, Hetfield, along with remaining Metallica members Ulrich, Hammett, Trujillo, as well as former bassist Newsted, and the deceased Cliff Burton (who was represented by his father), were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[22] In an interview after their nomination, Hetfield commented that everyone who had appeared on an album with the band would be inducted. This excluded original guitarist Dave Mustaine and original bassist Ron McGovney, as both had appeared only on the band's early demo tapes. Hetfield and the rest of Metallica, including Newsted, performed \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Enter Sandman\" to end the ceremony.\n\nHetfield has been called \"The King of Downpicking\" for his right-hand picking speed by Annihilator guitarist Jeff Waters.[23] He has explained he holds the pick with his thumb, index and middle fingers, rather than just the thumb and index, citing additional stability he gains by it.[24]\n\nHetfield married Francesca Tomasi on August 17, 1997, and together they have three children. He currently resides in Vail, Colorado, citing a \"multitude of reasons\" for moving there, including it being his wife's childhood hometown, the natural beauty, and the quiet environment.[25] During an interview on NPR's Fresh Air, Hetfield stated that his wife had helped him to mature and learn to deal with his anger issues more constructively, explaining that after they met, his destructive tendencies embarrassed both of them.[26] Hetfield filed for divorce in 2022 citing irreconcilable differences.[27]\n\nHetfield's son Castor is also a musician, playing for the Savannah, Georgia-based band Bastardane as their drummer.[28]\n\nHetfield has long struggled with addiction problems. In 2001, he entered a rehab program (documented in the film Metallica: Some Kind of Monster), and by early 2002, he began maintaining total abstinence from alcohol.[29] In a 2010 interview with So What!, the official magazine of Metallica's fan club, Hetfield stated that he is a \"reborn straight edge\".[30] However, in 2019, Hetfield once again entered rehab, forcing Metallica to cancel their Australia/New Zealand leg of the WorldWired Tour.[31] Hetfield made his first public appearance since leaving rehab at the Petersen Automotive Museum reception on January 30, 2020.[32]\n\nHetfield enjoys a variety of activities, most notably hunting; farming and beekeeping; customizing cars and motorcycles in his garage; watching the Las Vegas Raiders, the San Francisco Giants, and the San Jose Sharks; and going to hot rod shows.[33] He put his 1968 Chevrolet Camaro up for sale on eBay, with the proceeds going to a Music for Schools program.[34] The car was used in the video for \"I Disappear\" and was given to him as a gift upon the video's completion. \"Slowburn\", his 1936 Auburn boat tail speedster, won the 2010 Goodguys West Coast Custom of the Year.\n\nHetfield has a number of tattoos, including one which shows flames encasing four playing cards\u00a0\u2013  ace (1), 9, 6, and 3\u00a0\u2013  representing the year of his birth, and the words \"Carpe Diem\" (\"seize the day\"). The flames on the tattoo are in reference to the pyrotechnic accident which he suffered in 1992 during a concert in Montreal.[35] He has tattooed an \"M\" and \"81\" on his right hand for \"Metallica\" and the year Metallica was founded, 1981, and an \"F\" on his left hand for \"Francesca\". He also has some Christian tattoos, including crosses and one of Jesus on his right arm. He has a tattoo of two razors forming the straight edge X symbol on his left wrist.[30]\n\nThe first single Hetfield ever bought was \"Sweet Home Alabama\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd.[36] He was featured in a documentary called Absent, directed by Justin Hunt, which takes a look at the effects of absent fathers on their children and the \"father wound\" that they leave behind.[37][38][39]\n\nHetfield has expressed his disdain for politics and celebrities who \"soapbox their opinions\", stating that \"for us, people are people\u00a0\u2013  you should all have your own opinion\".[40] In 2007, Metallica performed at London's Live Earth concert. When Hetfield was asked for his thoughts on climate change, he responded by saying:\n\nI really avoided the press around the Live Earth day. I didn't quite agree with what was going on there. Politics drive me crazy, and I don't like talking politics. Politics get in the way of things; they get in the way of getting things done, and getting our music across is what we wanna do\u00a0\u2013  we don't wanna cloud it with Democrat, Republican, whatever. Our philosophy is 'think for yourself' at the end of the day\u00a0\u2013  do what you think feels right. I really believe that humans will survive. I have a lot of faith in mankind that we will overcome and adapt\u00a0\u2013  whatever it is; whether it's man-made or God-made, or Earth/Mother Nature\u00a0\u2013  we have a lot of smart people on this planet that will make something good out of bad.[41]\nIn 2008, responding to the use of Metallica's music to torture Iraqi prisoners, Hetfield was unoffended and replied, \"If the Iraqis aren't used to freedom, then I'm glad to be part of their exposure.\"[42] British band Chumbawamba subsequently released a song called \"Torturing James Hetfield\" as a direct response.[43] In a 2017 interview, Hetfield reaffirmed his previous stance, saying, \"I'm honored my country is using something to help us stay safe, if they are. But then again, once the music is out, I don't have control over that. Just like how someone's giving it away online. They're using it to do what they do.\"[44]\n\nHetfield has been a major endorser of ESP Guitars since the 1980s, and is best known for playing custom-made Explorer-style guitars with an EMG 81/EMG 60 set for pickups and since then he has his own signature EMG JH pickups.[45] Hetfield's main guitar from the early days was a Flying V copy made in Japan by Electra, which was modified with a Seymour Duncan Invader (SH-8) pickup and used almost exclusively until 1984 when he switched to the Gibson Explorer model.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, ESP produced the first of his signature model guitars. To date, Hetfield has had six signature guitars with the company. However, Hetfield often uses guitars from Gibson and other companies instead of ESP despite his endorsement.\n\nSome of Hetfield's guitars over the years have included:\n\nThroughout Metallica's career, Hetfield has used a wide range of different amplifiers. For the first two albums, he used Marshall heads and cabinets, with occasional effects. The specific Marshall that he used for Kill 'Em All was stolen after a concert prior to the recording of Ride the Lightning; Hetfield was extremely upset by the theft, as his mother had helped him purchase the amplifier before her death. In 1985, for the recording of Master of Puppets, he and Kirk Hammett each bought a Mesa/Boogie Mark IIC+ amplifier (the preamp sections of which were connected to Marshall power amplifiers), and since then he has mostly used Mesa/Boogies, including the Triaxis and Rectifier models. Around the time of St. Anger, Hetfield began using the Diezel VH4 head. The majority of his clean tones come from a Roland JC-120 Jazz Chorus Guitar Amplifier, although many different amplifiers have been used over the years.\n\nIn December 2011, it was announced by Fortin Amps that they would team up with Randall Amplifiers to start a new line of tube amplifiers based on the Fortin Meathead amplifier. Kirk Hammett currently has two prototypes, and Hetfield will eventually be receiving one.\n\nThe amplifiers currently used on tour by Hetfield are:\n\nTo avoid problems with pedals being damaged during live performances, Hetfield keeps his effect pedals in a rack along with his amplifiers and his guitar technician controls them through a pedalboard sidestage. The pedal controller allows him to change between different effect pedals and amplifiers.\n\nHetfield's live rig in 2008 included:\n\n\n\nIn 2010, a Line 6 effects unit was added to the list, along with the TC Electronic unit, perhaps indicating that this had replaced his stompboxes.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Hetfield uses Shure Super 55 microphones for vocals.\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson", "content": "\n\nPaul Bruce Dickinson (born 7 August 1958) is an English singer who is best known as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden. Dickinson has performed in the band across two stints, from 1981 to 1993 and from 1999 to the present day. He is known for his wide-ranging operatic vocal style and energetic stage presence.\n\nDickinson began his career in music fronting small pub bands in the 1970s while attending school in Sheffield and university in London. In 1979, he joined British new wave heavy metal band Samson, with whom he gained some popularity under the stage name \"Bruce Bruce\" and performed on two studio records. He left Samson in 1981 to join Iron Maiden, replacing Paul Di'Anno, and debuted on their 1982 album The Number of the Beast. During his first tenure in the band, they issued a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nDickinson quit Iron Maiden in 1993 (being replaced by Blaze Bayley) to pursue his solo career, which saw him experiment with a wide variety of heavy metal and rock styles. He rejoined the band in 1999, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, and has released six subsequent studio albums with the band. Since his return to Iron Maiden, he has released two further solo records, in 2005, Tyranny of Souls and The Mandrake Project in 2024.[1] His younger cousin, Rob Dickinson, is the former lead singer of British alternative rock band Catherine Wheel, while his son, Austin, fronted the metalcore band Rise to Remain. Since Bruce Dickinson joined Iron Maiden in 1981, the band has sold well over 100 million albums as of 2024.[2]\n\nOutside his career in music, Dickinson has pursued a number of other activities. He undertook a career as a commercial pilot for Astraeus Airlines, which led to a number of media-reported ventures such as captaining Iron Maiden's converted charter aeroplane, Ed Force One, during their world tours. Following Astraeus' closure, in 2012 he created his own aircraft maintenance and pilot training company, Cardiff Aviation. Dickinson presented his own radio show on BBC Radio 6 Music from 2002 to 2010, and has also hosted television documentaries, authored novels and film scripts, created a beer with Robinsons Brewery and competed at fencing internationally.\n\nPaul Bruce Dickinson was born on 7 August 1958 in Worksop, Nottinghamshire.[3] His mother, Sonia, worked part-time in a shoe shop, and his father, Bruce, was a mechanic in the British Army.[4] His birth hurried the young couple, who were then just teenagers, into marriage.[3] Initially, he was brought up by his grandparents; his grandfather was a coal-face worker at the local colliery, and his grandmother was a housewife.[3] This is referred to in his song \"Born In '58\" from the album Tattooed Millionaire.[5] Dickinson started school at Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield.[3] Soon afterwards, when he was six, he was also despatched to Sheffield,[6] where he attended a primary school in Manor Top.[7] After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior.[7] Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as he was unable to make close friends.[8] Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper Helena Stormanns, who was born in 1963.[9] He tried to isolate himself from her as much as he could when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.[10]\n\nDickinson's first musical experience was dancing in his grandparents' front room to Chubby Checker's \"The Twist\", when he still lived with them in Worksop.[11] The first record Dickinson recalls owning was the Beatles single \"She Loves You\", which he managed to persuade his grandfather to buy him, which made him more interested in music.[11] He tried to play an acoustic guitar belonging to his father, but it blistered his fingers.[7] By the time he moved to Sheffield, Dickinson's parents were earning a good living from buying property, refurbishing it and then selling it for a profit.[12] As a result, much of Dickinson's childhood was spent living on a building site, until his parents bought a boarding house and a bankrupt garage where his father began selling second-hand cars.[7] The income from their business success gave them the opportunity to give Dickinson\u2014then 13 years old\u2014a boarding school education and they chose Oundle, a public school in Northamptonshire.[7] Dickinson was not opposed to moving away from home because he had not built \"any real attachment\" to his parents, having been raised by his grandparents in Worksop until he was six.[7]\n\nAt Oundle, Dickinson was picked on and routinely bullied by the older boys of Sidney House, the boarding house that he belonged to,[13] which he described as \"like systematic torture\" and meant that he became an outsider.[10] His interests at Oundle were often military; he co-founded the school wargames society with Mike Jordan, and he joined the school's cadet force.[13] This gave him access to live ammunition, which he used to create explosions as booby-traps.[14] Oundle was where Dickinson became attracted to progressive rock and early heavy metal after hearing Deep Purple's \"Child in Time\" being played in another student's room.[14] As a result, the first album he ever bought was Deep Purple's In Rock, which created his interest in rock and metal music.[15] After In Rock, he went on to buy Black Sabbath's debut, Jethro Tull's Aqualung and Tarkus by Emerson, Lake & Palmer.[15] Every term, a band would play at the school, the first of these which Dickinson saw was called Wild Turkey, featuring former Jethro Tull bassist Glenn Cornick.[15] After that, he saw Van der Graaf Generator and Arthur Brown.[15]\n\nDickinson initially wanted to play the drums,[15] later obtaining a pair of bongo drums from the music room for practice.[16] He remembers playing \"Let It Be\" with his friend Mike Jordan, during which Dickinson discovered his singing voice while encouraging Jordan to sing the high-notes.[16] Shortly afterwards Dickinson was expelled from Oundle for participating in a prank in which he allegedly urinated in the headmaster's dinner.[16] Returning home to Sheffield in 1976, Dickinson enrolled at King Edward VII School, at which he joined his first band.[17] He had overheard two other pupils talking about their band and that they needed a singer and so volunteered immediately.[17] They rehearsed in the garage of the drummer's father, and the band were impressed by Dickinson's singing, encouraging him to buy his first microphone.[17] Their first gig took place at the Broadfield Tavern in Sheffield.[17] Originally called \"Paradox\", the band changed their name on Dickinson's suggestion to \"Styx\", unaware of the American act with the same name.[18] They made local newspaper headlines when a steel worker was awoken by their performance and tried to smash the band's drum kit.[19] Soon afterwards the band split up.[18]\n\nAfter leaving school with A-levels in English, History, and Economics, Dickinson confessed, \"I didn't really know what I wanted to do.\"[18] The first thing he did was join the Territorial Army for six months.[18] Although he enjoyed his time in the TA, Dickinson realised that it was not a career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary College, London.[18] His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his \"cover story\", and immediately began playing in bands.[18] At university, Dickinson got involved in the Entertainments Committee: \"one day you'd be a roadie for the Jam, the next you'd be putting up the Stonehenge backdrop for Hawkwind or whatever.\"[20] In 1977, Dickinson met Paul \"Noddy\" White, a multi-instrumentalist who owned a public address system (PA) and other equipment, with whom Dickinson, along with drummer Steve Jones, would form a band together called Speed.[20] According to Dickinson, the band was called Speed because of the way in which they played, rather than a reference to drug-taking.[20] In Speed, Dickinson began writing his own material after White taught him how to play three chords on the guitar.[20]\n\nAlthough Speed would play several gigs at the Green Man pub in Plumstead, the band did not last long, but it encouraged Dickinson to continue to work towards being a musician.[20] Dickinson spotted an advertisement in Melody Maker with the caption \"Singer wanted for recording project\" and replied immediately.[20] He recorded a demo tape and sent it with a note which read: \"By the way, if you think the singing's crap, there's some John Cleese stuff recorded on the other side you might find amusing.\"[20] They liked what they heard and invited Dickinson down to the studio to make \"Dracula\", the first song he would ever record, with a band called \"Shots\",[20] formed by two brothers, Phil and Doug Siviter.[21] The song would later appear on the second disc of The Best of Bruce Dickinson compilation. The brothers were impressed with Dickinson's vocal abilities and asked him to join their group.[22]\n\nDickinson played pubs with Shots on a regular basis to small audiences.[22] One particular night, Dickinson suddenly stopped in the middle of a song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention.[22] He got such a good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience's attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman.[22] The next step in Dickinson's career was taken in a pub called the Prince of Wales in Gravesend, Kent, where Shots were playing regularly, when Barry Graham (\"Thunderstick\") and Paul Samson paid a visit.[23] Impressed with his stage-act, they talked with Dickinson afterwards and invited him to be their new singer.[24] Dickinson agreed to join their band, Samson, but only once he'd finished taking his History finals two weeks later.[24] Until that point, he had been neglecting his University education.[24] As a result, the university had tried to kick him out for failing his Second Year exams and not paying his accommodation fees, but he was saved because of his role as Entertainments Officer.[24] After writing six months' worth of essays in the space of two weeks and some last minute cramming for his exams, Dickinson achieved a 2:2.[24]\n\n\"In my na\u00efvety, I thought people who were in rock 'n' roll bands were great artists, and it was a huge shock to the system to realise that they weren't, that they didn't even aspire to be, really. Some of them did, maybe, but some of them, like Samson, were very frightened of the idea.\"\n\nAfter meeting Paul Samson and Barry Purkis at the Prince of Wales, and while still undertaking his final university exams, Dickinson joined Samson onstage at Bishop's Stortford to perform one of their songs, \"Rock Me Baby\", cementing his role as their new lead vocalist.[26]\n\nThe band had already released their debut album, Survivors, in 1979 on an independent label, two months before Dickinson joined.[24] Immediately following the completion of his University work, he met up with the band at Greenwich's Wood Wharf studios to learn the Survivors album.[27] Although the tracks did not suit his vocal style,[28] the band soon wrote the majority of the following Head On album in their earliest rehearsal sessions,[29] some of which were immediately incorporated into their live set.[28]\n\nIt was during these early rehearsals that the nickname \"Bruce Bruce\" came about, derived from Monty Python's \"Bruces sketch\".[29] The name became very tiresome as the band's management continually wrote dud cheques, made payable to \"Bruce Bruce\", as a joke.[30] Dickinson later commented that he did not like it but considered it \"a sort of stage name\" and accepted it.[30]\n\nDickinson was dismayed to learn that not all rock performers were \"great artists\"; he felt that some, such as Samson, were only interested in women, drugs and alcohol, which he was unable to relate to.[25] Although he had smoked joints before,[25] Dickinson discovered that it was impossible to communicate with other band members if he was sober, deciding that it was \"the price that had to be paid\".[30]\n\nWhile fronting the band, Dickinson also came across Iron Maiden for the first time, who were supporting Samson at the Music Machine in 1980.[31] As Dickinson recalls; \"I was watching them, and they were good, really fucking good, and at that moment, I remember thinking, 'I wanna fucking sing for that band. In fact, I'm going to sing for that band! I know I'm going to sing for that band!' ... I just thought, 'This is really me. Not Samson.'\"[31]\n\nDickinson remained in the band for another year, recording two studio albums with them\u2014Head On and Shock Tactics.[30] However, Samson soon ran into difficulties with their record label, Gem, who went out of business and failed to finance their European tour in support of Iron Maiden.[32] The band were turned over to RCA, which began neglecting the group, and so they promptly fired their management team and the resulting injunction meant that their equipment was reclaimed and they could not be paid for their concert performances.[32] The band's last gig was at Reading Festival, after which Dickinson was approached by Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, who asked him to audition to be their new lead vocalist.[33]\n\nDickinson went to audition for Iron Maiden at a rehearsal room in Hackney in September 1981 and immediately discovered that this was a much more professional operation than he was used to with Samson.[34] In the practice rooms, the band played through \"Prowler\", \"Sanctuary\", \"Running Free\" and \"Remember Tomorrow\", before asking Dickinson to sing the same songs again in a recording studio, and he was immediately inducted into the group.[34]\n\nIron Maiden had a strict and organised routine that suited the band's writing style, which Dickinson described as a \"time table\".[35] After a few gigs, they began writing new material for their third album, The Number of the Beast, released in 1982. In the wake of Samson's contractual problems, Dickinson could not legally be credited on any of the record's songs,[36] having to make, what he called, a \"moral contribution\", later revealing that he had contributed to \"The Prisoner\", \"Children of the Damned\" and \"Run to the Hills\".[37] In the documentary 12 Wasted Years, manager Rod Smallwood refers to \"The Prisoner\" as being co-written by Dickinson and Adrian Smith. The album was a major success, topping the British charts,[38] and earning platinum status in the UK and the US.[39] Following the release, the band embarked on a supporting tour around the globe.\n\n\"I guess it was the first time I really thought about leaving. I don't just mean Iron Maiden, I mean quitting music altogether. I just thought, 'Nothing is worth feeling like this for.' I began to feel like I was a piece of machinery, like I was part of the lighting rig.\"\n\nOn the following albums, 1983's Piece of Mind and 1984's Powerslave, Steve Harris's song-writing monopoly was pushed aside in favour of other members' ideas, with Dickinson contributing to a number of tracks, including the singles \"Flight of Icarus\" and \"2 Minutes to Midnight\".[41] Throughout the World Slavery Tour, as part of the new theatrical elements incorporated into the band's stage-show, Dickinson wore a feathered mask during \"Powerslave\".[42] This was the band's longest tour to date, during which Dickinson considered going home mid-tour, due to the high number of shows.[43] Iron Maiden's management were continually adding dates, until Dickinson demanded that they stop or he would leave the group.[40]\n\nAfter a six-month break, which Dickinson mostly spent practising fencing,[44] Iron Maiden began writing their next album, Somewhere in Time. Dickinson was disappointed with the effort as he felt that the band needed a more dramatic stylistic departure from past records to remain relevant, despite its introduction of synthesised bass and guitars.[45] He has no writing credits on the release, as his material, based on his own suggestion that the album should be more acoustic-focused, was rejected by the rest of the band.[45] Steve Harris, on the other hand, stated that his material was rejected because it was not good enough, and that Dickinson \"was probably more burnt out than anyone at the end of the last tour\".[46]\n\nAfter a subsequent tour, Iron Maiden started working on their next studio effort, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which featured more progressive rock elements than the band's previous records.[47] Although it became their second release to top the British charts,[38] it was also Dickinson's first album with the band that did not achieve platinum status in the US.[48] Unlike Somewhere in Time, Dickinson was much more enthusiastic about this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits.[49] After the following tour in 1988, the band decided to take a year off.[50]\n\n\"I thought it wouldn't be a problem to go out and do the shows at all ... but it wasn't a good vibe ... we walked out onstage and it was like a morgue. The Maiden fans knew I'd quit, they knew these were the last gigs, and I suddenly realised that, as the frontman, you're in an almost impossible situation. If you're like, 'Wow, this is really fucking cool tonight, man,' they're all gonna sit there going, 'What a wanker. He's leaving. How can it be cool?' Or do you go on and say, 'Look, I'm really sorry I'm leaving \u2013 not to put a damper on the evening, but I am quitting'? I mean, what do you do?\"\n\nDuring the next album's writing stage, Adrian Smith left Iron Maiden, and was replaced by Janick Gers. Iron Maiden's eighth studio release, 1990's No Prayer for the Dying, had a raw sound that, according to a retrospective assessment by AllMusic, did not \"hold up well\" compared to past efforts,[52] as it was recorded in a barn which Steve Harris owned, with a mobile studio owned by the Rolling Stones.[53] The record featured Dickinson's \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", originally composed for a film soundtrack, which despite receiving a Golden Raspberry Award for worst original song in 1989, became the band's first and only single to top the UK Singles Chart.[38] By 1992, Harris had converted his barn into a proper studio, and the new album, Fear of the Dark, was recorded there,[54] resulting in a better overall sound than No Prayer for the Dying,[55] although Dickinson still says it had limitations due to its size.[53]\n\nAfter the Fear of the Dark Tour, Dickinson decided to leave Iron Maiden to concentrate on his solo career.[56] At that point the band had already booked a following tour in 1993, which Dickinson did not enjoy. Throughout the tour, Dickinson drew a lot of criticism from his bandmates, with Steve Harris in particular saying, \"I really wanted to kill him.\"[51] According to Harris, Dickinson would only perform when the press was there,[57] whereas at other concerts he would only mumble his way through songs.[51] Dickinson has since denied the accusations that he was deliberately under-performing, arguing that it was impossible to give a decent performance some nights because of the atmosphere.[57] His last performance with the band on 28 August 1993 was filmed by the BBC at Pinewood Studios and released as a live video the following year, entitled Raising Hell.[58]\n\nAlong with Adrian Smith, Dickinson rejoined Iron Maiden in 1999 with Janick Gers remaining in the band, after he was approached by manager Rod Smallwood.[60] Smallwood also spoke to Steve Harris about Dickinson's return, who initially had reservations about the prospect, but soon came round to the idea, deliberating that they knew of his abilities and that it was a case of \"better the devil you know\".[60] Harris and Dickinson agreed to meet at Smallwood's home in Brighton in January 1999 for the first conversation they would have with each other since 1993.[61] Although both men were nervous about the encounter, upon seeing each other the tension immediately dissipated and both agreed that Dickinson should return to the group.[61]\n\nAfter embarking on a small tour, the band set about recording Brave New World, their first studio album with Dickinson since 1992. Dickinson insisted that they find a replacement for the now retired Martin Birch, the band's regular producer, and record in a different studio than the one in which they made No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark, to which Harris agreed.[62] The album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley,[63] after which Iron Maiden undertook a supporting tour culminating with a performance at the Rock in Rio festival before a crowd of 250,000.[64]\n\nIn 2003, they recorded and released Dance of Death at London's SARM Studios with Kevin Shirley, now the band's new regular producer.[65] After two further stints on the road (Dance of Death World Tour and Eddie Rips Up the World Tour) Iron Maiden returned to SARM in 2006 to record their next studio album, A Matter of Life and Death,[66] and embarked on a supporting tour. In 2008 and 2009, the band set out on the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour,[67] which has since been described as \"groundbreaking\"[68] for its use of Ed Force One, the band's customised Boeing 757, flown by Dickinson himself,[67] and led to the documentary film Iron Maiden: Flight 666, which had a limited cinema release in April 2009.[69] Iron Maiden held another world tour in 2010 and 2011 in support of The Final Frontier,[70] their first album recorded at Compass Point Studios, Nassau, Bahamas since 1986's Somewhere in Time,[71] and which peaked at No.\u00a01 in 28 countries.[72]\n\nIn September 2014, Iron Maiden began recording their sixteenth studio album, The Book of Souls, at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris.[73] The release features two songs written solely by Dickinson for the first time since Powerslave, \"If Eternity Should Fail\" and \"Empire of the Clouds\",[74] the former originally penned for a possible solo record.[75] \"Empire of the Clouds\" is the band's longest ever song, at over 18 minutes in length,[76] and features Dickinson on piano for the first time, which is how the song was written.[75] The band toured the album in 2016, during which Dickinson once again piloted the band's private plane, Ed Force One (now a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet).[77]\n\nOzzfest incident\n\nIn 2005, Iron Maiden co-headlined the US festival tour, Ozzfest, with Black Sabbath. Lead singer Ozzy Osbourne's wife, Sharon, encouraged family friends and members of other bands to sabotage Iron Maiden's last performance at Hyundai Pavilion in San Bernardino, California, on 20 August,[79] in an attack which Rod Smallwood criticised as \"vile, dangerous, criminal and cowardly\", as well as disrespectful to fans who had paid to see the band perform \"a full unhindered performance\".[80] Osbourne ordered interference with the band's PA, delayed the entrance of Eddie, the band's mascot,[81] and encouraged members of the Osbourne camp to throw eggs, lighters and bottle tops from the front of the audience.[82]\nAccording to Dickinson, the attack was in response to his \"disparaging remarks about reality TV shows that she took personally\",[citation needed] although The Guardian reported that he slated[vague] the Osbournes' reality series and accused Ozzy Osbourne of using a teleprompter.[81] Dickinson has since denied making comments against Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath,[83] but admitted that he criticised Ozzfest throughout the tour, attacking their \"corporate\" seating layout and saying, \"Most of the bands are there because they paid to be there.\"[84]\n\nFollowing the concert at San Bernardino, Osbourne released a further statement which accused Dickinson of making several anti-American comments,[85] for which Classic Rock stated that \"nobody can present any cast-iron evidence\".[78] In addition, Osbourne claimed that the flag-waving during \"The Trooper\" was disrespectful to American troops,[85] at the time fighting alongside the British in Iraq, even though Dickinson had always held a Union Flag during the song, being based on the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War.[78] It was also reported that Steve Harris had spoken to Ozzy Osbourne in San Bernardino, apologising for Dickinson's comments,[86] which Harris denies, stating that his words had been \"twisted\".[83]\n\nJuly 2022 Athens concert incident\n\nDickinson is known for publicly reprimanding fans at Iron Maiden concerts if he feels they are out of line. One such incident occurred during the band's Legacy of the Beast Tour concert at the Olympic Stadium in Athens, Greece, on July 16, 2022, when Dickinson used offensive language to attack the nationality of a Greek fan who had lit up a flare as the frontman was about to sing \"The Number Of The Beast\".[87] His fans in Greece showed a degree of sympathy, but most were disappointed by the gesture, as lighting up flares when the band plays a classic hit is customary at Greek concerts to honor the band.\n\nIn February 2024, Dickinson admitted in an interview for the Greek magazine Rock Hard that he had lost his temper when asked about his reaction to the flare at the Athens 2022 concert.[88]\n\nIn early 1989, Zomba asked Dickinson to produce a track for the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,[89] providing a budget, a studio, and a producer, Chris Tsangarides. Dickinson took up the opportunity and called an old friend of his, former Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, and, shortly after meeting up, they had \"Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter\" ready for the studio,[90] then recorded with the assistance of bassist Andy Carr, and drummer Fabio del Rio.[91] \"I wrote it in about three minutes\", states Dickinson, \"I don't know where the title 'Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter' came from, but it just popped into my head. I thought, 'Bloody hell, straight out of AC/DC!' And I thought, 'Nightmare on Elm Street. Yeah, that'll do.'[92] Impressed with the results, Zomba asked Dickinson if he was willing to record a whole album as well.[92] With the same line-up and producer, Dickinson's solo debut, Tattooed Millionaire, was written and recorded within two weeks, and released in May 1990,[92] followed by a supporting tour.[93]\n\nLater that year, Dickinson participated on a re-recording of Deep Purple's \"Smoke on the Water\", as part of the humanitarian effort Rock Aid Armenia. Backed by the band Skin, he produced a cover version of Alice Cooper's \"Elected\", along with Rowan Atkinson (in character as Mr. Bean), which was used in 1992 for Comic Relief,[94] and five years later, on Bean Soundtrack.[95]\n\nFor his second solo effort, Dickinson received the collaboration of American producer, Keith Olsen, and, while working on the record in LA, decided to leave Iron Maiden.[56] Unhappy with the direction he was taking with Olsen, Dickinson began working with Tribe of Gypsies guitarist Roy Z and started the album again from scratch.[35] Balls to Picasso was recorded with Tribe of Gypsies as the backing band,[35] and was released in 1994. That same year, Dickinson recorded a cover version of \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" with the band Godspeed for Black Sabbath's tribute album Nativity in Black.[96] Tribe of Gypsies departed to work on their own material and Dickinson tracked down another band, including his new writing partner and guitarist, Alex Dickson.[35] While touring with this new outfit in 1994, Dickinson performed in Sarajevo, then under siege during the Bosnian War; a documentary film based on the concert, entitled Scream For Me Sarajevo, completed filming in December 2015.[97]\n\nAfter the Balls to Picasso supporting tour finished, he started working on a new studio record, Skunkworks. Dickinson decided that Skunkworks would be the title of the band as well, but the record company refused to release the album without his name on the cover.[98] Dickinson hired producer Jack Endino, most noted for producing the first Nirvana album. The \"Skunkworks\" entity ceased to be when the tour ended. \"I was devastated by the Skunkworks thing\", stated Dickinson, \"Skunkworks was a record which I tore myself apart to make and nobody seemed to give a shit.\"[99]\n\nAfter a short period of inactivity, Dickinson once again teamed up with Roy Z and Tribe of Gypsies to record his next album, Accident of Birth; \"It was actually Roy that dragged me back into some assemblance, because he called up and he said, 'Listen, I've got some stuff and it's like a metal record.' And I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't really sure that I had anything to offer\u00a0... Then he played me some backing-tracks he'd done for what was to become Accident of Birth down the phone and I thought 'There is something there.'\"[99] Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit.[100] The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, \"The album's heavy feel is very satisfying, and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90's.\"[100] The follow-up, The Chemical Wedding, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blake's writings; with some songs, such as \"Book of Thel\", having the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring one of his paintings.[99] The record was even more successful than its predecessor, with Sputnikmusic commenting, \"Bruce had shattered all expectations to create an album that might even be better than the previous one.\"[101] During The Chemical Wedding's supporting tour, the live album, Scream for Me Brazil was recorded in S\u00e3o Paulo, after which Dickinson and Smith returned to Iron Maiden in February 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Dickinson performed vocals on the song, \"Into the Black Hole\", for Ayreon's Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator.[102] Later that year, he collaborated with Judas Priest's front-man, Rob Halford, recording, \"The One You Love to Hate\", for Halford's debut, Resurrection.[103] A compilation, entitled The Best of Bruce Dickinson, was released in late 2001, including two new songs and a bonus disc of rarities.[104] His sixth solo album, Tyranny of Souls was released in May 2005. This time the song-writing was all split between Roy Z and Dickinson and many songs were composed by Z sending recordings of riffs to Dickinson while he was on tour with Iron Maiden.[105] On 21 June 2005, Dickinson's complete solo discography was re-released, featuring bonus discs with rare and remastered tracks. That same year, Dickinson contributed to the song, \"Beast in the Light\", from Tribuzy's album, Execution, and their subsequent live album.[106] A three-DVD box set, entitled Anthology, was released on 19 June 2006, containing concerts and promo videos from throughout his solo career, as well as an old Samson video, entitled \"Biceps of Steel\".[107]\n\nA fan of the Monty Python comedy troupe, in 2009 Dickinson appeared in Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut). He also recorded a new version of the theme song from Monty Python's Life of Brian for the sixth and final episode.[108] In December 2017, Dickinson said that he has tentative plans for his next solo album to be \"a whole concept album\", with the title being If Eternity Should Fail, the same song name from Iron Maiden's album The Book of Souls, in which he confirmed that it was originally penned as a solo track, \"So if I did do another solo album, which I think I will, I might just stick to my original plan and have that as the title track. I mean, I did write it \u2013 it was the first track that I wrote for it. So, yeah, I'd probably still include that song. But it would be\u2026 the feel would be slightly different \u2013 not very much, though \u2013 from the Maiden version.\"[109] Dickinson released The Mandrake Project, his first solo studio album in 19 years, in March 2024. It was produced by Roy Z.[110]\n\nDickinson married Erica \"Jane\" Barnett in 1984,[111] and they divorced in 1987.[112] With his second wife, psychotherapist Patrice \"Paddy\" Bowden, he has three children.[113] All three were born in the Chiswick area of London,[113] where Dickinson lived for a few decades beginning in 1981.[114] In 2020, it was reported that he and Bowden had separated earlier after almost 30 years of marriage; Bowden died in an accident at her home in May 2020.[115] As of May 2020[update] Dickinson lives with his girlfriend Leana Dolci in Paris.[115]\n\nDickinson's son Austin was the lead singer in metalcore band Rise to Remain until their break-up in 2015,[116] at which point he formed the alternative metal group As Lions.[117] His other son Griffin, who previously worked as a stage carpenter for Iron Maiden during their tours,[118] was the lead singer of melodic hardcore band SHVPES.[119] Dickinson's cousin, Rob Dickinson, was the lead singer of alternative rock band Catherine Wheel and founded the American company Singer Vehicle Design.[120]\n\nIn an interview with Sarah Montague for BBC's HARDtalk in 2012, Dickinson agreed that he is a conservative and a Eurosceptic.[121] Dickinson said in a 2018 interview with French magazine L'Obs that, despite residing mainly in France, he supported Brexit and voted for the UK to leave the EU during the 2016 referendum.[122][123] In 2021, after the Withdrawal Agreement entered into force, Dickinson said he was angry that British musicians and performers were restricted from free travel through Europe.[124]\n\nIn 2015, Dickinson underwent seven weeks of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for a cancerous tumour found at the back of his tongue.[125] Dickinson's medical team expected him to make a full recovery as the tumour was discovered in the early stages.[126] On 15 May, Dickinson was given the all-clear by his specialists.[127]\n\nOn 19 July 2011, Dickinson was presented with an honorary music doctorate from his alma mater, Queen Mary University of London, in honour of his contribution to the music industry.[128]\n\nIn 2019, Dickinson was made an honorary citizen of Sarajevo and received the city's prestigious Sixth April Award for his efforts in performing under siege in 1994. According to the city's mayor, it was his arrival in Sarajevo that \"was one of those moments that made us realize that we will survive, that the city of Sarajevo will survive, that Bosnia and Herzegovina will survive\".[129] He is also credited as a producer on the critically acclaimed 2016 documentary Scream for Me Sarajevo, which chronicles this performance and his return to Sarajevo.[130]\n\nIn 2019, Dickinson was also presented with an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Philosophy by the University of Helsinki.[131]\n\nOn 6 January 2020, Dickinson was made an Honorary Group Captain of 601 (County of London) Squadron RAF.[132]\n\nIn 2024, Dickinson was made an honorary citizen of Curitiba City, Brazil.[133]\n\nDickinson's interests and non-musical activities include writing, broadcasting, fencing (at which he has competed internationally, placing 7th in Great Britain,[134] and has founded a fencing equipment company under the brand name \"Duellist\"),[135] beer brewing and aviation. Due to the wide variety of Dickinson's pursuits, Intelligent Life named him as a living example of a polymath in 2009.[136]\n\nDickinson learned to fly recreationally in Florida in the 1990s[137] and now holds an airline transport pilot's licence. He regularly flew Boeing 757s in his role as captain for the now-defunct British charter airline Astraeus,[138] which, from 16 September 2010, employed him as marketing director.[139] One of his key roles in that position was to promote Astraeus' services by increasing their number of videos,[140] leading to the Civil Aviation Authority releasing a video featuring Dickinson on aircraft loading safety in June 2011.[141]\n\nFollowing Astraeus' closure on 21 November 2011, Dickinson branched into entrepreneurship when he launched Cardiff Aviation Ltd on 1 May 2012, an aircraft maintenance business based at the Twin Peaks Hangar in St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales.[142] According to The Wall Street Journal, in January 2013 Cardiff Aviation had created 40 jobs and hoped to have over a hundred personnel by the summer of 2013.[143] In June 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that the business had expanded to between 60 and 70 employees and were in discussions to set up their own airline.[144] In August 2015, Cardiff Aviation signed a deal to provide airline support to Air Djibouti,[145] for whom Dickinson piloted their maiden flight the following year, a Boeing 737 from Cardiff to Djibouti.[146] As a result of his business ventures, Dickinson delivered keynote speeches at events around the globe, including Queen Mary University of London's Innovation Showcase in November 2012,[147] Connect2Business, Stockholm in March 2013,[148] Aviation Week's MRO Europe Conference, London in October 2015[149] and \"Blog Now, Live Forever\", Mumbai in October 2015.[150]\n\nDickinson's role as a pilot has led to some high-profile flights, which include returning a group of British RAF pilots from Afghanistan in 2008,[151] 200 British citizens from Lebanon during the Israel/Hezbollah conflict in 2006,[152] and 180 stranded holiday makers from Egypt following the collapse of XL Airways UK in September 2008.[153] In addition, he flew Rangers F.C. and Liverpool F.C. to away matches in Israel and Italy in 2007 and 2010, respectively.[154]\n\nFor the 2008\u201309 \"Somewhere Back in Time World Tour\", he piloted Iron Maiden's chartered Boeing 757, dubbed \"Ed Force One\", specially converted to carry the band's equipment between continents,[67] which subsequently led to a documentary film, Iron Maiden: Flight 666.[155] Dickinson flew \"Ed Force One\" again for \"The Final Frontier World Tour\" in 2011.[156]  For the 2016 The Book of Souls World Tour, the band upgraded to a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, which meant that Dickinson had to undertake type conversion to fly the aircraft.[77] In 2014, Dickinson purchased a Fokker Dr.I triplane replica G-CDXR and joined the Great War Display Team, which re-enacts First World War air battles at air shows across the UK.[157]\n\nDickinson presented Bruce Dickinson's Friday Rock Show on BBC radio station 6 Music from 2002 to 2010. In March 2010, the BBC announced that, after over eight years, Dickinson's show was to be axed.[158] His final broadcast was on 28 May 2010, with the regular format abandoned in favour of a personal and musical tribute to the recently deceased Ronnie James Dio. Dickinson scorned BBC executives for the cancellation, playing the Johnny Paycheck version of \"Take This Job and Shove It\".[159] In addition to his show on 6 Music, Dickinson also hosted a series entitled Masters of Rock on BBC Radio 2 from 2003 to 2007.[160] Dickinson's catalogue of 6 Music programmes were acquired in 2014 by TeamRock radio, who began re-broadcasting episodes in December.[161]\n\nIn 2005, Dickinson hosted a five-part historical TV series about aviation, Flying Heavy Metal, shown on the Discovery Channel and later on Discovery Turbo in the UK.[113] He was a guest on an episode of the Military Channel's The Greatest Ever, where he drove a Russian T-34 tank. In 2006, Dickinson presented a documentary for Sky One called Inside Spontaneous Human Combustion with Bruce Dickinson, in which he investigated the phenomenon by enlisting the help of several experts and performing various experiments to determine its possible cause.[162] Other television appearances include guesting on quiz shows such as Never Mind the Buzzcocks and the short-lived Space Cadets, as well as the chat show Clarkson, hosted by Jeremy Clarkson.[163] Dickinson has also appeared in a BBC series called The Paradise Club, undertaking the role of a musician named Jake Skinner.[93] On 27 July 2012, Dickinson spent a day being filmed as a guest star for a season four episode of Ice Pilots NWT, in which he flew a Douglas DC-3 and took part in \"touch-and-go drills\" in a Douglas DC-4 with Buffalo Airways.[164]\n\n\"I always fancied the idea of writing a book, and I was bored on the road, so I sat down and started at page one! I had an idea for this character called Lord Iffy Boatrace, who's an upper class chinless wonder. I wrote it the same way I write a song.

About halfway through you suddenly realise what it is you're writing about.\"\n\nDuring a 1986\u20131987 Iron Maiden tour, and in the wake of a divorce, Dickinson started writing his first book.[112] Inspired by the novels of Tom Sharpe, in addition to Biggles and Penthouse, he created The Adventures of Lord Iffy Boatrace,[166] which Kerrang! describes as \"a satirical swipe at fetishism among the upper classes\",[165] and whose title character is a \"semi-transvestite\" British land owner.[166]\n\nFollowing its completion, Dickinson approached Sidgwick & Jackson, who, according to Dickinson, agreed to publish the book before reading it, solely based on Iron Maiden's album sales.[165] Released in 1990 (ISBN\u00a00-283-06043-3), the novel sold more than 40,000 copies almost immediately.[167] Due to the high demand, Sidgwick & Jackson asked Dickinson to produce a sequel,[167] which became 1992's The Missionary Position (ISBN\u00a00-283-06092-1), a satire of televangelism.[167] No further additions to the series have been published, although Dickinson did write the first 60 pages to a prequel, set during \"Lord Iffy's schooldays\", which he \"just thought was rubbish and ripped it all up. I didn't think it was funny.\"[168]\n\nDickinson also turned his hand to scriptwriting, co-authoring Chemical Wedding with director Julian Doyle. The film, in which Dickinson played a few small cameo roles and composed the soundtrack, was released in 2008 and starred Simon Callow.[citation needed]\n\nOn 15 October 2015, HarperCollins and Dey Street announced that they would publish Dickinson's memoirs.[169] What Does This Button Do?[170] was released on 19 October 2017.[171]\n\nIn 2013, Iron Maiden collaborated with Robinsons Brewery in Stockport to create Trooper, a 4.8% cask/4.7% bottled ale[172][173] whose recipe Dickinson formulated with head brewer Martyn Weeks.[174] As of May 2014, the beer has sold 2.5\u00a0million pints in 40 countries, making it Robinsons' most successful export.[174]\n\nFollowing Trooper's success, Dickinson, a fan of traditional English cask beer,[175] stated that he intends to develop more beers in the future, although new products will be \"under the umbrella of Trooper and not Iron Maiden [as] Trooper has taken on a life of its own. People drink it because they like the beer, not because they are Maiden fans.\"[176] Additional beers have included Trooper Red 'N' Black Porter (5.8 per cent ABV), Trooper Hallowed (6.0 per cent ABV), and a limited-edition \"666\" (at 6.66 per cent ABV).\n\nIn 2023, Dickinson created a Trooper Progressive Lager[177] together with the German craft beer brewery Crew Republic.\n\nAlthough Dickinson never received formal training, he possesses a wide vocal range which is characterised by his quasi-operatic tenor.[178] Along with Ronnie James Dio and Rob Halford, Dickinson is one of the pioneers of the operatic vocal style later to be adopted by power metal vocalists and regularly appears near the top in lists of the greatest rock vocalists/front-men of all time.[179] Dickinson says that his style was influenced primarily by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill (Van der Graaf Generator), Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) and Ian Gillan (Deep Purple).[104]\n\nDickinson's singing varied in the 1990s in the recording of albums such as No Prayer for the Dying, Fear of the Dark and his first solo work Tattooed Millionaire, making use of a much more raspy and unpolished sound,[180] befitting their stripped down style.[181] Since returning to Iron Maiden in 1999, his singing style has returned to much like it was in the 1980s,[182] though his voice has lowered with age.[183] According to a report published in the Daily Mirror, Dickinson has an estimated vocal range of 4.25 octaves.[184] His voice led to the nickname \"The Air Raid Siren\", which Billboard states is \"due to the ferocious power of his singing\",[185] although Dickinson said it actually originated from a fan complaint.[186]\n\nIn addition to his vocal ability, Dickinson has been described as an energetic stage performer.[187] He considers including the audience \"the essence of the Maiden experience\" and that his role is to \"shrink the venue ... to turn that football stadium into the world's smallest club\".[188] To achieve this, Dickinson seeks eye contact with audience members[189] and urges them to join in with the phrase \"scream for me\" (followed by the concert's location).[190] He is critical of performers who do not connect with their fans, particularly those who \"[hide] behind the amps\" and use an autocue, remarking that \"people pay good money and [they] can't even remember the sodding words\".[189]\n\nASTRAEUS Airlines Capitan\n\nBBC Radio Awards\n\nBogota International Airport\n\nButanan Institute S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nCAERDAV\n\nCalifornian Buckwheat Named After Iron Maiden's Frontman\n\nCongress of Argentina Honours\n\nEl Salvador Ministry of Tourism\n\nFilm Festival of Sarajevo\n\nGolden Raspberry Award\n\nHollywood's RockWalk\n\nHonorary Citizen of Curitiba City\n\nHonorary Citizen of Sarajevo\n\nIntelligent Life Magazine\n\nKart Races S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nMatwatches France\n\nQMUL Engagement and Enterprise Award\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\nRhode Island International Film Festival\n\nRobinsons Brewery Award\n\nRock Aid Armenia\n\nRoyal Air Force (RAF UK)\n\nRoyal Mail Honors\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo International Airport\n\nTAM Museu\n\nThe Sixth April Award \n\nTuzla Film Festival\n\nUK British Fencing Veterans\n\nUK's National Fencing Team\n\nUniversidad Cat\u00f3lica del Ecuador\n\nUniversity do Tri\u00e2ngulo\n\nUniversity of Helsinki\n\nUniversity of Queen Mary\n\n\n\nIron Maiden\n\nSolo\n\nSamson\n\nSpecial appearances\n\n^ * Dickinson appeared on the album's re-issue only, as the original version was completed before he joined the band.\n\nThe tour takes place between the 2023 and 2024 legs of Iron Maiden's The Future Past World Tour.[225]\n"}, {"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmy", "content": "\n\nIan Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945 \u2013 28 December 2015), better known as Lemmy Kilmister or simply Lemmy, was a British musician. He was the founder, lead singer, bassist and primary songwriter of the rock band Mot\u00f6rhead, of which he was the only continuous member, and a member of Hawkwind from 1971 to 1975.\n\nA foundational force in the genre following the advent of the new wave of British heavy metal, Lemmy was known for his appearance, which included his signature friendly mutton chops, his military-influenced fashion sense and his gravelly rasp of a voice. It was once declared \"one of the most recognisable voices in rock\".[1] He was also noted for his unique posture when singing, which was once described as \"looking up towards a towering microphone tilted down into his weather-beaten face\".[2] He was also known for his bass playing style, using his Rickenbacker bass to create an \"overpowered, distorted rhythmic rumble\".[2] A notable aspect of his bass sound was his guitar-like riffing, often playing power chords using heavily overdriven tube stacks by Marshall.\n\nLemmy was born in Stoke-on-Trent and grew up between there, the nearby towns of Newcastle-under-Lyme and Madeley, and later the Welsh village of Benllech, Anglesey.  At a later point, Lemmy remembers living briefly at Gwrych Castle, Abergele.[3] He was influenced by rock and roll and the early works of the Beatles, which led to him playing in several rock groups in the 1960s, such as The Rockin' Vickers. He worked as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix and The Nice before joining the space rock band Hawkwind in 1971, singing lead vocals on their hit \"Silver Machine\". In 1975, he was fired from Hawkwind after an arrest for drug possession. That same year, he founded Mot\u00f6rhead. The band's success peaked around 1980 and 1981, including the hit single \"Ace of Spades\" and the chart-topping live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith.\n\nLemmy continued to record and tour regularly with Mot\u00f6rhead until his death on 28 December 2015 in Los Angeles, where he had lived since 1990. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer two days before his death. Alongside his music career, he had minor roles and cameos in film and television. He was known for his hard-living, road-driven lifestyle, which included chain-smoking and daily consumption of large amounts of alcohol and amphetamine.\n\nLemmy was born Ian Fraser Kilmister in the Burslem area of Stoke-on-Trent on 24 December 1945.[4][5] When he was three months old, his father, an ex-Royal Air Force chaplain and concert pianist,[6] separated from his mother. He moved with his mother and grandmother to nearby Newcastle-under-Lyme, then to Madeley.[7] When Ian was 10, his mother married former rugby player George L. Willis, who already had two older children from a previous marriage, Patricia and Tony, whom Ian disliked. They later moved to a farm in the Welsh village of Benllech, with Lemmy commenting that \"funnily enough, being the only English kid among 700 Welsh ones didn't make for the happiest time, but it was interesting from an anthropological point of view\".[8] He attended Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones, a comprehensive school in Amlwch, where he was nicknamed \"Lemmy.\"[9] It was later suggested by some that the name originated from the phrase \"lemmy [lend me] a quid 'til Friday\" because of his alleged habit of borrowing money from people to play slot machines,[7][10][11][12] although Lemmy himself said that he did not know the origin of the name.[13] He soon started to show an interest in rock and roll, girls, motorbikes and horses.\n\nAt school, Lemmy noticed a pupil who had brought a guitar to school and had been \"surrounded by chicks.\" His mother had a guitar, which he then took to school, and was himself surrounded by girls even though he could not play. By the time he left school, he had moved with his family to Conwy. He went on to work several odd jobs, including one at the local Hotpoint electric appliance factory, while also playing guitar for local bands such as the Sundowners and spending time at a horse-riding school.[7] He saw the Beatles perform at the Cavern Club in Liverpool when he was 16, and then learned to play along on guitar to their first album Please Please Me. He also admired the sarcastic attitude of the group, particularly that of John Lennon,[14] and later said of the group, \"Brian Epstein cleaned them up for mass consumption, but they were anything but sissies. They were from Liverpool ... a hard, sea-farin' town, all these dockers and sailors around all the time who would beat the piss out of you if you so much as winked at them. ... The Rolling Stones were the mummy's boys\u2014they were all college students from the outskirts of London. ... The Stones made great records, but they were always shit on stage, whereas the Beatles were the gear.\"[15]\n\nIn Stockport, Lemmy joined local bands the Rainmakers and then the Motown Sect who played northern clubs for three years. In 1965, he joined The Rockin' Vickers[16] who signed a deal with CBS, released three singles and toured Europe, reportedly being the first British band to visit the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Rockin' Vickers moved to Manchester, where they shared a flat together.[7]\n\nLeaving the Rockin' Vickers, Lemmy moved to London in 1967. He shared a flat with Noel Redding, bassist of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and with Neville Chesters, their road manager. He got a job as a roadie for the band.[1] In 1968, he joined the psychedelic rock band Sam Gopal under the name Ian Willis and recorded the album Escalator which was released in 1969.[17] After meeting Simon King at a shopping centre in Chelsea in 1969, he joined the band Opal Butterfly, but the group soon disbanded, having failed to raise enough interest with their singles.[7]\n\nIn August 1971, Lemmy joined the space rock band Hawkwind, who were based in Ladbroke Grove, London, as a bassist and vocalist. He had no previous experience as a bass guitarist, and was cajoled into joining immediately before a benefit gig in Notting Hill by bandmate Michael \"Dik Mik\" Davies, to have two members who enjoyed amphetamine.[18] Lemmy states that he originally auditioned for Hawkwind as a guitarist, but on the morning of the Notting Hill gig, they decided not to get another guitarist. By chance, the bass player did not show up and left his equipment in the van. He often said, \"Their bass player was pretty much saying 'please steal my gig!' So I stole his gig.\" Lemmy quickly developed a distinctive style that was strongly shaped by his early experience as a rhythm guitarist, often using double stops and chords rather than the single note lines preferred by most bassists. His bass work was a distinctive part of the Hawkwind sound during his tenure, perhaps best documented on the double live album Space Ritual. He also provided the lead vocals on several songs, including the band's biggest UK chart single, \"Silver Machine\", which reached #3 in 1972.\n\nIn May 1975, during a North American tour, Lemmy was arrested at the Canadian border in Windsor, Ontario, on drug possession charges. The border police mistook the amphetamine he was carrying for cocaine and he was kept overnight in jail before being released without charge. The band and management were concerned that his arrest might stop the band from crossing back into the United States, even though he had been released without charge. They were also tired of what they saw as his erratic behaviour, so they decided to fire him.[19][20]\n\nHe once said of Hawkwind: \"I did like being in Hawkwind, and I believe I'd still be playing with them today if I hadn't been kicked out. It was fun onstage, not so much offstage. They didn't want to mesh with me. Musically, I loved the drummer, the guitar player. It was a great band.\u201d [21]\n\nAfter Hawkwind, Lemmy formed a new band called \"Bastard\" with guitarist Larry Wallis (former member of the Pink Fairies, Steve Peregrin Took's band Shagrat and UFO) and drummer Lucas Fox. Lemmy and Took were friends, and Took was the stepfather to Lemmy's son Paul. When his manager informed him that a band by the name of \"Bastard\" would never get a slot on Top of the Pops, Lemmy changed the band's name to \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" \u2013 the title of the last song he had written for Hawkwind.[22]\n\nSoon after, Wallis and Fox were replaced with guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke and drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor and with this line-up, the band began to achieve success. Lemmy's guttural vocals were unique in rock at that time, and were copied during the time when punk rock became popular.[citation needed] The band's sound appealed to Lemmy's original fans and, eventually, to fans of punk. Lemmy asserted that he generally felt more kinship with punks than with metalheads; he also played with the Damned for a handful of gigs when they had no regular bassist.[23] Mot\u00f6rhead's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 with several UK chart hits, including the single \"Ace of Spades,\" which remained a crowd favourite throughout the band's career, and the UK #1 live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith.[24] Mot\u00f6rhead became one of the most influential bands in the heavy metal genre. Their \u2013 and Lemmy's \u2013 final live performance was in Berlin, Germany, on 11 December 2015 during the band's 40th Anniversary Tour.[25]\n\nAt the age of 17, Lemmy met a holidaying girl named Cathy. He followed her to Stockport, where she gave birth to his son Sean, who was put up for adoption.[7] In the 2010 documentary film Lemmy, he mentioned having a son whose mother had only recently reconnected with him and \"hadn't got the heart to tell him who his father was.\" Later, during his time with The Rockin' Vickers, he slept with a woman in Manchester named Tracy; she had a son, Paul Inder, whom Lemmy met six years later. As an adult, Inder became a guitarist and occasionally joined Lemmy on stage.[7]\n\nLemmy lived in Los Angeles from 1990 until his death in 2015, his last residence being a two-room apartment two blocks away from his favourite hangout, the Rainbow Bar and Grill.[26]\n\nIn the 2005 Channel 4 documentary Mot\u00f6rhead: Live Fast, Die Old, it was claimed that Lemmy had slept with over 2,000 women. He later quipped, \"I said more than 1,000; the magazine made 2,000 of it.\" Maxim had Lemmy at No. 8 on its top ten \"Living Sex Legends\" list, as they claimed that he had slept with around 1,200 women.[27] He is featured in the book Sex Tips from Rock Stars (2010) by Paul Miles.[28]\n\nDave Grohl, on his Probot website, describes musicians with whom he has worked. In his entry for Lemmy, he wrote:\n\nWe recorded [Lemmy's] track in Los Angeles in maybe two takes about a year and a half ago. Until then I'd never met what I'd call a real rock 'n' roll hero before. Fuck Elvis and Keith Richards, Lemmy's the king of rock 'n' roll\u2014he told me he never considered Mot\u00f6rhead a metal band, he was quite adamant. Lemmy's a living, breathing, drinking and snorting fucking legend. No one else comes close.[29]\nLemmy was well known for his heavy drinking. The documentary Mot\u00f6rhead: Live Fast Die Old stated that he drank a bottle of Jack Daniel's every day and had done so since he was 30 years old.[30] In 2013, he stopped drinking Jack Daniel's for health reasons.[31] During his time with Hawkwind, he developed an addiction to amphetamine and LSD, particularly the former. Before joining Hawkwind, he recalled Dik Mik, a former Hawkwind sound technician, visiting his home in the middle of the night and taking amphetamines with him. They became interested in how long \"you could make the human body jump about without stopping\", which they did for a few months until Mik ran out of money and wanted to return to Hawkwind, taking Lemmy with him.[11]\n\nI first got into speed because it was a utilitarian drug and kept you awake when you needed to be awake when otherwise you'd just be flat out on your back. If you drive to Glasgow for nine hours in the back of a sweaty truck you don't really feel like going onstage feeling all bright and breezy. [...] It's the only drug I've found that I can get on with, and I've tried them all\u00a0\u2013 except smack [heroin] and morphine: I've never \"fixed\" [injected] anything.[11]\nIn November 2005, he was invited to the National Assembly for Wales as a guest speaker by Conservative member William Graham. He was asked to express his views on the detrimental effects of drugs and called for the legalisation of heroin. He stated that legalisation would eradicate the drug dealer from society and generate money from its taxation, however hard this would be to accept.[32]\n\nLemmy collected German military regalia; he had an Iron Cross emblazoned on his bass, which led to accusations of Nazi sympathies. He stated that he collected Nazi memorabilia because he liked the way it looked, and he considered himself an anarchist.[33][34] He spoke against racism many times. [35][36][37][38]  Lemmy said he was against religion, government, and established authority.[39][40] In 2011, he identified as agnostic, saying: \"I can find out when I die. I can wait. I'm not in a hurry.\"[41] Jeff Hanneman, the founder of the thrash metal band Slayer, befriended Lemmy due to their shared fondness for collecting Nazi memorabilia.[42] According to Keith Emerson's autobiography, Lemmy gave him two of his Hitler Youth knives during his time as a roadie for the Nice. Emerson used these knives many times as keyholders when playing the Hammond organ during concerts with The Nice and Emerson, Lake & Palmer before destroying them. Lemmy defended his collection by saying that if his then-girlfriend (who was black) had no problem with it, nobody else should.[40]\n\nIn December 2000, Lemmy's tour was cancelled when he was hospitalised in Italy with the flu, exhaustion, and a lung infection.[43] He was hospitalised with extreme dehydration and exhaustion in Germany in July 2005.[44] As he grew older, he consumed less alcohol and drugs because he suffered from diabetes and hypertension. In June 2013, it was reported that he had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fitted.[1] His tour was cancelled in July 2013 due to a severe haematoma.[45] He referred to his continuing drug use as \"dogged insolence in the face of mounting opposition to the contrary\".[40] Towards the end of his life, he had to use a walking stick.[46] He had started smoking at the age of 11.[47] In August 2015, he said he had cut down his smoking habit from two packs a day to one pack a week.[48] He was hospitalised with a lung infection in September 2015, after having breathing problems when performing onstage.[49]\n\nOn 28 December 2015, Lemmy died at his Los Angeles apartment from prostate cancer, cardiac arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure.[50][51][52] Mot\u00f6rhead announced his death on their official Facebook page later that day. According to the band, his cancer had only been diagnosed two days prior to his death.[53]\n\nLemmy's manager, Todd Singerman, later revealed:\n\nHe [Lemmy] gets home [from tour], we have a big birthday party for him at the Whisky a Go Go. His friends came down and played. Two days later I could tell he wasn't feeling good. So we took him to the hospital. They release him. Then after the brain scan, they found the cancer in his brain and his neck. The doctor comes with the result a couple of days later and says \"It's terminal.\"[54]\nLemmy's doctor had given him between two and six months to live. Mikael Maglieri, owner of his nearby hangout Rainbow Bar and Grill, subsequently had a video game machine that Lemmy was fond of playing taken from the establishment and put in Lemmy's apartment so he could continue playing it from his bedside.[55] Although his manager had planned to keep the news private until his eventual death, Lemmy strongly encouraged him to make the diagnosis public in early 2016, but he died before a press release could be drafted.[55]\n\nLemmy's memorial service took place at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills, on 9 January 2016.[1] The service was streamed live over YouTube with more than 230,000 people logging on to watch,[56] while others gathered at the Rainbow. His body was cremated following the funeral. His remains were placed in a 3D-printed urn shaped like his trademark cavalry hat and emblazoned with the slogan \"Born to lose, lived to win\".[57] The piece was on display during his funeral and was later interred at Forest Lawn.[58]\n\nIn March 2021, it was revealed that some of Lemmy's ashes were, by his own request, put into bullets and sent to his closest friends, including Whitfield Crane, Rob Halford, Michael Monroe, Doro Pesch and Riki Rachtman.[59][60] In August 2023, it was reported that some of Lemmy's ashes were also scattered into the mud at Wacken Open Air music festival.[61] In April 2024, it was reported James Hetfield got an Ace of Spades tattoo with some of Lemmy\u2019s ashes in it. [62]\n\nIn various media, additional tributes appeared from fellow rock stars such as Rob Halford, Dave Grohl, Ozzy Osbourne,[63] Alice Cooper, Metallica,[64] Scott Ian of Anthrax,[65] and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.[66]\n\nIn 2005, the UK magazine Classic Rock presented Lemmy with its first \"Living Legend\" award.[67] In a 2013 interview with the magazine, Lemmy said he had never expected to make it to 30, but he spoke very pointedly about the future, indicating neither he nor the band was obsessing about the end:\n\nDeath is an inevitability, isn't it? You become more aware of that when you get to my age. I don't worry about it. I'm ready for it. When I go, I want to go doing what I do best. If I died tomorrow, I couldn't complain. It's been good.[68]\nIn February 2016, the Hollywood Vampires performed at the Grammy Award ceremony as a tribute to Lemmy.[69] On 11 June, Download Festival paid tribute to Lemmy by renaming the main stage the \"Lemmy Stage\", and in the slot where Motorhead were due to play, there was a video tribute to Lemmy in which they played his music and his peers talked about him.[70] On 17 November, Metallica released a tribute song titled \"Murder One\", named after Lemmy's frequently used amp. The song, from their album Hardwired... to Self-Destruct, depicts Lemmy's rise to fame. On 18 January 2017, Lemmy was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for being the creator of thrash metal.[71] In 2017, the extinct crocodile relative Lemmysuchus[72] was named after Lemmy.[73] On 14 November 2016, asteroid 243002 was officially named 243002 Lemmy,[74] complementing asteroid 250840 Motorhead, named after the band in 2014.[75]\n\nIn 2018, Hawkwind recorded a new acoustic version of Lemmy's \"The Watcher\" (originally recorded on Doremi Fasil Latido, 1972) on the album The Road to Utopia with production, arrangement and additional orchestrations by Mike Batt and a guest appearance from Eric Clapton.[76]\n\nLemmy worked with several musicians, apart from his Mot\u00f6rhead bandmates, over the course of his career. He wrote the song \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S\" for the Ramones, which he played in his live sets as a tribute to the band. He also produced a Ramones EP and an album for Warfare entitled Metal Anarchy in which W\u00fcrzel guested on guitar, He was brought in as a songwriter for Ozzy Osbourne's 1991 No More Tears album, providing lyrics for the tracks \"Hellraiser,\" (which Mot\u00f6rhead later recorded themselves and released as a single), \"Desire,\" \"I Don't Want to Change the World\" and the single \"Mama I'm Coming Home\". Lemmy noted in several magazine and television interviews that he made more money from the royalties of that one song than he had in his entire time with Mot\u00f6rhead. After being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2000, for which he was hospitalised briefly, Lemmy again appeared with Mot\u00f6rhead at WrestleMania X-Seven playing WWE wrestler Triple H to the ring. Lemmy published his autobiography, White Line Fever, in November 2002. In 2005, Mot\u00f6rhead won their first Grammy in the Best Metal Performance category with their cover of Metallica's \"Whiplash\". In the same year he began recording an unreleased solo album titled Lemmy & Friends, which was intended to include a collaboration with Janet Jackson.[77]\n\nIn 2014, he established his own recording label, Motorhead Music, to promote and develop new talent. Acts he signed to the label and helped develop include Barb Wire Dolls, Budderside, Others, and Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons.[78]\n\nLemmy made appearances in film and television, including 1990 science fiction film Hardware and the 1987 comedy Eat the Rich, for which Mot\u00f6rhead also recorded the soundtracks including the title song. He appeared as himself in the 1986 The Comic Strip Presents... episode \"More Bad News\", along with fellow heavy metal musicians Ozzy Osbourne, the Scorpions and Def Leppard. In 1984, Mot\u00f6rhead were the musical guests on the TV show The Young Ones, in the episode \"Bambi\". He appears in the 1994 comedy Airheads (in which he is credited as \"Lemmy von Mot\u00f6rhead\").[79][80] Lemmy has a cameo in Ron Jeremy's 1994 pornographic film John Wayne Bobbitt Uncut as the discoverer of Bobbitt's severed penis. The appendage is thrown from the window of a moving car and lands at Lemmy's feet who exclaims: \"Looks like a dick! Fucking hell! Ah well, it's not mine at least.\" The film's soundtrack also features the Mot\u00f6rhead song \"Under the Knife\".[81]\n\nHe has also appeared in several movies from Troma Entertainment, including the narrator in 1996's Tromeo and Juliet and as himself in both Terror Firmer and Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV. His last role was portraying the President of the United States in Return to Nuke 'Em High. He has a cameo role in the film Down and Out with the Dolls (Kurt Voss, 2001). He appears as a lodger who lives in a closet.[82] He appeared[when?] on Down and Dirty with Jim Norton as the series DJ, and also wrote the theme music.[83] He appeared in a 2001 advertisement for Kit Kat, playing violin as part of a string quartet in a genteel tearoom.[84] In 2015, Lemmy appeared as a central figure in the Bj\u00f6rn Tagemose-directed silent film Gutterd\u00e4mmerung opposite Grace Jones, Henry Rollins, Iggy Pop, Tom Araya of Slayer and Eagles of Death Metal's Jesse Hughes.[85]\n\nThe 2010 rockumentary film Lemmy was directed and produced by Greg Olliver and Wes Orshoski. It consists of a combination of 16 mm film and HD video footage, produced over three years.[86] It features interviews with friends, peers, and admirers such as Dave Grohl, Slash, Ozzy Osbourne, James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo of Metallica, David Ellefson of Megadeth, Scott Ian of Anthrax, Alice Cooper, Peter Hook of Joy Division/New Order, Dee Snider, Nikki Sixx, Mick Jones of the Clash, Ice-T, Kat Von D, Henry Rollins, Lars Frederiksen of Rancid, Jim Heath of The Reverend Horton Heat, Slim Jim Phantom of the Stray Cats, Mike Inez, Joan Jett, pro skateboarder Geoff Rowley, pro wrestler Triple H, \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, Jarvis Cocker, Marky Ramone, former Hawkwind bandmates Dave Brock and Stacia, and Steve Vai.[87]\n\nHe was the main character in the 16-bit video game Mot\u00f6rhead, released for the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST in 1992.[88] Lemmy also appeared as an unlockable character in the 2009 game Guitar Hero: Metallica.[89] He also provided his voice for the 2009 video game Br\u00fctal Legend, voicing the Kill Master, a character designed and based on his surname and likeness.[90] Lemmy was also the inspiration for the Mario character Lemmy Koopa, who made his first appearance in Super Mario Bros. 3.[91] In the Victor Vran Downloadable content \"Motorhead Through The Ages\", there is a new \"Lemmy's Outfit\" armour. The other Mot\u00f6rhead bandmates' armour is also available. As an easter egg, a holographic woman in the final level of 2020's DOOM Eternal proclaims, \"Lemmy is God!\". The appearance of the character King Novik from the same video game is also loosely based on facial features of Lemmy.[92] Deep Rock Galactic features one of Lemmy's hats as a cosmetic called \"The Ace of Spades\" with the description \"In honor of a motoring head.\"\n\nLemmy positioned his microphone in an uncommonly high position, angled so that he appeared to be looking up at the sky rather than at the audience. He said that it was for \"personal comfort, that's all. It's also one way of avoiding seeing the audience. In the days when we only had ten people and a dog, it was a way of avoiding seeing that we only had ten people and a dog.\"[93] Inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Lemmy recorded his vocals in the studio in total privacy, meaning he would sing in an enclosed recording booth where no one can see him, not even the producer.[94]\n\nAs a member of Hawkwind, Lemmy first used a Rickenbacker belonging to Dave Anderson. When Anderson failed to show up for a charity gig, Lemmy took his place. Following the departure of Anderson, Kilmister bought a Hopf Studio bass off Hawkwind synth player Del Detmar.[15] He used Rickenbacker basses[95] for most of his career. In September 1996, a Rickenbacker belonging to him was a featured part of the Bang Your Head exhibition at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, US.[96] From 1996 onward, Lemmy's main bass was a Rickenbacker 4001LK, from a limited edition run of 50 instruments, featuring hand carved body wings, featuring oak leaves, three HB1 humbucker pick-ups and all gold plated hardware. Lemmy had commented that at last Rickenbacker had made decent pick-ups. When asked about the appeal of the Rickenbacker instruments, Lemmy said \"The shape. I'm all for the image \u2014 always. If you get one that looks good, you can always mess with the pickups if it sounds bad.\"[97]\n\nWith Hawkwind Lemmy used a Selmer amplifier. With Motorhead, he got a Marshall Amplification 1992 JMP Super Bass Mark 2 bass stack[98] from 1976, with a 4x15\" and a 4x12\" cabinet. In 2008, Marshall issued a model dedicated to Lemmy, the 1992LEM, which was available with the same cabinets Lemmy used.[99]\n\nLemmy described his style as \"I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings. I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like having a deep guitarist.[100]\n\nLemmy's unconventional playing style changed the dynamics of the group's rhythm section. Hawkwind drummer Simon King explained that \"A lot of the time I play with [guitarist] Dave - he'll get into a kind of rhythmic thing and I'll follow him so you get this kind of percussion and rhythmic guitar thing going, so Lemmy can loon forward a bit because he's very much a front man and gives off a lot of energy, so he can get out front and play a sort of lead on bass which sometimes is very effective\",[101] and Mot\u00f6rhead drummer Taylor echoed the sentiment with \"Onstage he's difficult to follow cos he's not really a bass player. There's no solid bass lines to follow. A lot of the time I play more with Eddie [Clarke] than with Lemmy, but he's out on his own because he is what he is.\"[102]\n"}]
